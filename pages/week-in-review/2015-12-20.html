* Bought an Aeron to celebrate my permanent residency. I have honestly been dreaming about treating myself to one of these chairs for the last three years. Finally I had a great reason and could work it into my budget. Stoked to tick off another dreamline goal (from the 4 hour work week).
* Locked in 30 days of part-time freelance work in Q1 2016; this is good for the budget.
* Helped out a friend with their travel planning and loaned a bunch of cold weather gear that'll save them buying new stuff. Love travel and helping out.
* Linked up with a Syrian refuggee who's interested to learn and practice coding.
* Startup up a meetup group called Webcrafters and held an initial planning session.
* Finished up the sitemap and prepared visual design options for Dana's wedding website.
