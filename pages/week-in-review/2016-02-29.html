* Had the mini serviced and now it's running like a dream.
* Went to the doctor for a check up, turns out I'm running like a dream too.
* Decided I should just take a rest/chill week so not much exercise / missed a bunch of my daily 750 words.
* Finished up and published a guide on Disqus comments for Knownly
* Confirmed a bunch more stuff in relation to the Visiting Entrepreneurs Program
* Finished an outline of my talk for Tuesday night @ Young Professionals Gold Coast
