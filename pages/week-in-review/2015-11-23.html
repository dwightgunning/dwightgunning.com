* Serious focus and coding this week. Found 'music for programming'
* Good progress on the client project early in the week to break ground on a couple challenging areas
* Booked flights back to Australia which is going to be a huge and awesome trip!
* Enjoyed reading 'Scaling as a Leader' (Firstround blog) which highlights the need for rhythm and cadence
