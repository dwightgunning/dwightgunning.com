<p>The <a href="http://www.sueandpaul.com/gmapPedometer/">Google Map Pedometer</a> is a groovy way to measure distances. I can't wait for google to implement the actual street maps in australia rather than just offering the 'satellite' option. That will blow the pants off of <a href="http://www.whereis.com.au">WhereIs</a>, who incidently never got back to me after I <a href="http://stuntshow.blogspot.com/2005/02/whereis-offers-web-service-api.html">requested a key for the WS interface</a>.I picked up that little gem from the <a href="http://planetweb20.com/">Planet Web 2.0</a> blog. It's a good'n!Also on said blog, although I don't see the Web2.0 fit, <a href="http://www.dontclick.it">dontclick.it</a> is kind of an interesting UI experiment that challenges our reliance on the mouse-click.
