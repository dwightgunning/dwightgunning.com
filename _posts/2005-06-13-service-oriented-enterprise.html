<p><a href="http://schneider.blogspot.com/archives/2005_06_12_schneider_archive.html">Service Oriented Enterprise</a>: "'SOA is first and foremost about a network of services. The value of your service network is directly related to the effort of creating/obtaining services and making them available. All networks require a critical mass of 'valuable services' before they become useful to the consumers. The SOA service network is no exception. What I'm saying is that you can take a slow and steady approach to SOA but be prepared to receive gains that are even slower. Remember - this is really about the 'network effect'."</p>
