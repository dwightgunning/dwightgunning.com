<p>Prague was excellent. I was a little apprehensive before arriving because the last time I was here (a 36 hour train stopover in reality) wasn't such a great experience.We split our time in the city into two parts. For the first two days we stayed on the eastern side of Nove Mesto at a hostel called Marabou. The second stint was the weekend and we were at Miss Sophie's on the southern edge of the inner city. A day trip to Pilsen slotted in between but this was an adventure that deserves a separate post.I took the first day at a very leisurely pace; wandering the cobble stone laneways of inner city Stare Mesto and across the Charles Bridge into Mala Strana, the Prague Castle and Hradcany. The streets and architecture are brilliant. The crowds at this time of year were much more manageable than what I experienced on my last trip which was at Christmas time.Andy arrived for the second day and I gave him a lightening fast tour that took in a lot of what I'd seen the day before. This was necessarily so we could head off for Pilsen by mid-afternoon.Returning to Prague on Thursday, we gatecrashed a friends Contiki pub crawl which turned out to be fun. It started at a pub called the "Beer Factory" where the attraction was a glass chiller and your own beer tap at each table.The weekend was jam packed and all good thanks to a visit from a friend who's living in London. We woke up and watched the AFL final at 6am which was a bag of fun and a major dissapointment at the same time. After going back to bed for a few hours sleep we made it to a walking tour in the afternoon. Dinner was a very tasty traditional Czech meal of goulash and potato pancakes. Sunday was a similar affair with a walking tour in the morning and stops at the Sex Museum and the Torture Museum.</p>
