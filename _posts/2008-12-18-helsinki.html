<p>In order to get on a cheap flight away from Moscow and across to Beijing, I decided to backtrack and detour through Finland for a night.Finland's capital turned out to be quite cool with a few interesting skate and street wear shops. I only had a few hours to explore and the rain was almost torrential so I didn't achieve a whole lot.Riding the trams around a fairly flat town center reminded me quite a bit of Melbourne. I might have felt like this because of the rain but I definitely think there were some similarities in the architecture of the two cities.For accommodation, I picked up couch with a guy named Antti. He had a pretty sweet little flat and a good outlook. Since he was coming off a big weekend and had to work Monday, we just chilled out and chatted with a couple of his Spanish friends who made a brief appearance.Not a bad litle way to spend a night. Hopefully next time I'll be in town when it's warmer and there is more time to check things out.</p>
