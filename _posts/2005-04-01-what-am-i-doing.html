<p>How slack am I, not blogging all week! I am really struggling to get in the groove of reading blogs, news etc. <i>and</i> putting in the hard yards at work. I guess the fact that most of my posts are just links to funny stuff I read, its no wonder I haven't posted. I simply haven't been reading anything. On the odd occasion I do come up with something to same all by myself, but being busy with work has kind of stiffled the creative flow. Anyway, I do apologise and I hope you will stick with me through the ebbs and flows.Now I'm going to start rambling about my RSS habbits. If you're one of my work mates and you're wondering what the hell RSS is, come ask me or email me, and I'll fill you in. Its the ticket!At the moment I'm letting RSS Bandit pull down around 250 items a day from 30 or so feeds. I've been trying to scan the items while I'm on the train, flagging anything that I want to take a look at later on. Invariably I'm so tired that I end up sleeping on the train so I'm ending up a long way behind. I've culled some feeds that I've gotten bored with or whose volume I simple cannot deal with. I've been making concerted effort to find more aussie bloggers... <a href="">Cameron Reilly</a> is a highlight. If you have ideas for how to better manage my feeds, let me know!As an aside, I've ordered a copy of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0142000280/104-0472760-1472702">Getting Things Done</a> by <a href="http://www.davidco.com/">David Allen</a>. It takes 4-6 weeks to ship according to the bookstore. As I joked with the lady at counter of said bookstore, I guess I won't be getting anything much done until sometime in May.</p>
