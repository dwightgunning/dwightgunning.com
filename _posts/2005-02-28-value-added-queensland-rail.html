<p>I spend approximately an hour and fifteen minutes travelling to work via train, each way. I'm fine with this as it lets me live on the Gold Coast where I'm close to the beach, friends and family while working a genuinely interesting day job. There is, however, something that <a href="http://www.qr.com.au">Queensland Rail</a> could do to make my trip more enjoyable and productive.I would love to see QR offer a WiFi service on its trains. That would be super cool and it would definitely be of benefit to a significant number of commuters. I figure if I'm spending this much time on the train getting to and from work, I might as well make use of that time to download and click through self-learning powerpoint presentations, perform housekeeping tasks like replying to emails and maintaining my calender. Being able to browse the web would be a serious bonus too. There's probably six or seven people per carriage, on average, who whip out their laptops when they board the train.The Queensland Government has set up a WiFi hotspot to encourage people to the Brisbane City Mall, they could do the same for the rail network. Queensland Rail are bankrolled by the state afterall. Peter Beattie, <a href="http://www.thepremier.qld.gov.au">Queensland Premier</a> and self confessed media-tart, would love to shout about it, after all its definitely in line with his 'Smart State' philosophy. Plus, with no other States offering wireless access (to my knowledge), Pete's got a golden opportunity to Trump his southern counterparts.This isn't revolutionary stuff either, with <a href="http:///www.gner.co.uk">GNER</a>, a UK rail company <a href="http://news.zdnet.co.uk/communications/networks/0,39020345,39118209,00.htm">trialled wireless access</a> on its trains back in 2003. So do it for the commuters!</p>
