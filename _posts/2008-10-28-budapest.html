<p><em>Apologies to all those who have been anxiously waiting for this next installment. I was flying under the radar for a few days and then got caught without accommodation in Cork on a bank holiday long weekend. So not a lot of time to write.</em>All the way through planning this trip I was excited to get back to Budapest as I think it's one of the most interesting and beautiful cities in Europe. The people are always warm, the architecture and sites are quite unique, and the nightlife is always on.We stayed in the Green Bridge hostel which is in a fairly central location, just two blocks back from the river on the eastern Pest side of town. Similar to the hostel in Krakow, there was a really good vibe around the place and we met some great people from Canada, the United States and a few other Aussies.The first trip was to SzÃ©chenyi FÃ¼rdÅ‘, the public baths. Since it was a warm and sunny day we spent a couple hours in the outdoor pools before heading inside to an 80Â°C sauna.Later in the afternoon we set off on a caving expedition which saw us spend about 4 hours in overalls crawling around underground. Watching Matt try to wriggle his huge frame through some relatively tight places (like the back of a volkswagon) proved quite amusing for the rest of the group.The next two days saw quite a bit of walking with trips over the Chain Bridge to the Buda castle, along the river to Parlament, through the Jewish quarter, and up the long and leafy Andrassy Utca to Hero's Square.
