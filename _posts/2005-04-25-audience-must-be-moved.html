<p>An <a href="http://www.beyondbullets.com/2005/04/ibm_logo_must_n.html">interesting post</a> at Beyond Bullets discusses how corporate templates can stiffle creativity and make it harder to get the message to the audience.I really like the objective that suggests we should make presentations 'about the audience' and not all about the organisation/presenter.</p>
