<p>I rarely come up with ideas that could be both beneficial to loads of people and make use of <i>in</i> technologies. I don't even know if this really qualifies, you be the judge.Some couriers let you track a package by entering an id number at their website. I'm more interested in changes to the status of the package &amp; how long its been since the last change then actually knowing where the package is... as long as it's moving I'm generally happy. So why can't I subscribe to a feed &amp; be notified when the status of the package changes. This would work well across the board for eCommerce sites.</p>
