<p>Here's Paul modelling the Spinner Hat. I'm not sure what he did to deserve it but I that the moment should be captured and placed on the web for posterity.<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/dwightgunning/52268352/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://static.flickr.com/29/52268352_d5a8a355fd_m.jpg" width="240" height="180" alt="Paul in the spinner hat" /></a>No doubt he'll have photographic evidence on <a href="http://smithslog.blogspot.com/">his blog</a> when I get my chance to model the colourful headwear.</p>
