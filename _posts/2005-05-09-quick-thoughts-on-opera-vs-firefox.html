<p>I've just about achieved a 50/50 balance in Opera/Firefox usage. Right now I'm kinda cheesed with Opera, as a software company. The 7.5 browser is awesome but its starting to annoy me that every major <i>point</i> zero release (eg 6.0,7.0,8.0) they've offered has had (what I believe should be) show-stopper bugs.That's part, but not all of the reason I started up Firefox. As I <a href="http://stuntshow.blogspot.com/2005/04/opera-8-and-delicious-firefox-toolbar.html">mentioned</a>, I was keen to try the del.icio.us plugin which turns out to be pretty cool. And now that I'm using Firefox, I'm stoked to see the effective search integration with <a href="http://www.dictionary.com/">dictionary.com</a> (as I'm not a great spellar) and other search engines. Opera has the mult-search thing going on but its not quite as nice, or extensible.If Opera had opened things up a bit with a flexible plugin framework I think they'd be doing a lot better. They have a pretty sound product that should be increasing its market share significantly as the average user wakes up and runs from IE. <a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing">Tim Bray's</a> regularly updated <a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2004/12/12/BMS">Browser Market Share</a> shows a consistent ~3% for Opera while Firefox makes steady gains, currently around 45% (Mozilla family). I put that down to the hype generated by the developer community who are motivated to extend upon the core browser functionality, not freeness or an Open-Source license.It's just so refreshing some competition is returning to the browser industry. I just hope Opera see why firefox is doing so well and embrace contributions from the user/dev community.</p>
