<p>Just reading <a href="http://www.43folders.com">43 Folders</a> and found a link to the <a href="">GTDTiddlyWiki</a>. It's a Wiki with a built-in framework for using the <i>Getting Things Done</i> productivity system. It really already does what I've been working towards with my JettyJSPWiki. This Wiki is built using just static HTML and JavaScript, requiring no Web Server at all. The best bit is that the download/install involves doing a <span style="font-family: courier new">File &gt; Save As</span> and then loading the local file in your browser. Cool.</p>
