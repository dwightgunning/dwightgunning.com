<p>Scoble, like everybody else, <a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/2005/07/09.html#a10573">is peeved</a> about blog-spam in search engine results and comment-spam on his blog.I'd say this is a prime opportunity for something like <i>social filtering</i> where the community gets control of whether a post will show up in blog search engine results or if a comment is worthy of being displayed. For comments, it would be pretty similar to what happens at <a href="http://www.slashdot.org">slashdot</a>.For spam blogs, once a certain number of users call bullshit on a given blog, its posts should no longer be returned in search results from <a href="http://www.technorati.com">technorati</a>.It should be pretty simple for technorati to implement a Service that recieves spam brandings from users. A firefox plug-in that adds a right click/context menu option would suffice from the client end.There should also be a 'tolerance' level set when a user performs a search, allowing them to adjust the level of dissaproval needed before a blog is filtered out of the results.
