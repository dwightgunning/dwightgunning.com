<p>Damn it's weird looking back at things you did a long while back. I've just spent the last hour updating my resume, which I last touched some time around April 2004. Out of curiosity, I also opened up some assignments that I did in high school and at university. Some of these pieces are not only poorly written, but they're also highly lame. I'm shocked.Has anybody else had experiences like that? Where you look back and think - did I really write that?</p>
