<p>I'm seriously craving a new gadget so I think it's time for a new phone. I don't really need it and I'm trying to save some coin for another snowboarding trip to Japan at the end of the year. But I sooooo like the looks of the <a href="http://www.nokia.com.au/nokia/0,,71453,00.html">Nokia 6680</a>.I saw it in a store on Saturday and kinda got hooked on the idea. It comes with a memory card slot and the ability to play mp3s. This would let me consolidate and not have to carry around a separate mp3 player.It's also G3/EDGE capable so when the all the providers roll out their next generation networks and the price war ensues I'll be able to get on a high-speed data plan.Last, I jest went to GPRS into the new <a href="http://mobile.technorati.com">Mobile Technorati</a> site and my <a href="http://www.nokia.com.au/nokia/0,8764,37035,00.html">6100</a> doesn't recognise the file format. Bummer.The Series 60 interface should be heaps cool too.Go drool over it at <a href="http://www.russellbeattie.com/notebook/1008503.html">Russ' Notebook</a>.</p>
