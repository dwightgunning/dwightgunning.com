<div>Here's <a href="">James Robertson quoting</a> from Tim Bray's post <a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2006/02/14/AJAX-Performance">The Real AJAX Upside</a>.<br />
<blockquote><i>I suspect thereâ€™s a huge system-wide optimization waiting out there for us to grab, by pushing as much of the templating and page generation work out there onto the clients. In particular, when youâ€™re personalizing a page, assign all the work you can to the personal computer sitting in front of the person in question. Yeah, that cool, responsive AJAXy stuff is nice but maybe itâ€™s the icing on the cake; the real win is making the Web run faster. ongoing doesnâ€™t do any sexy-UI stuff, but you know, the page content could be a lot more dynamic, and thereâ€™s no reason for it to run slower; or even to upgrade from the single fairly-basic Athlon that hosts it.</i>That's a good idea, but it has one downside: the compatibility issue. I dropped a simple javascript html editor into my comment page here, and Mac users got up in arms over it - because the editor doesn't work with Safari. That's the sort of issue that any push like this will hit, unfortunately.</p></blockquote>
<p>From what I've heard, this sounds like a pretty soft downside. Cross-browser compatibility seems to be on the improve and JavaScript libraries are out there which do a pretty good job of shielding application developers from remaining inconsistencies. <a href="http://getahead.ltd.uk/dwr/">DWR</a>, an AJAX-to-Java adapter has some smarts built-in to deal with these issues.</div>
