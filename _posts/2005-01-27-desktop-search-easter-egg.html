<p>I doubt if any recent Microsoft releases contain <i>real</i> easter eggs but I've fond memories of playing the primative MS Excel <a href="http://www.cs.mun.ca/~gstarkes/misc/easter.html#xl97">Flight Simulator</a>.<a href="http://weblog.infoworld.com/udell/2005/01/25.html#a1157">Jon Udell</a> gives the rundown &amp; a screencast of what looks to me like an accidental easter egg; full-text searching via the Window's search tool.<br />
<blockquote>Today's screencast is a 90-second short film that demonstrates <a href="http://www.theinquirer.net/?article=20214">Simon Burns'</a> astonishing finding that desktop search has been right under our noses for years -- built into Windows but then crippled by weird design choices.</p></blockquote>
