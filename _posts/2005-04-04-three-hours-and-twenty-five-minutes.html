<p>That's the slow way home.Something screwed up with the train system when I was 1/2 way home. Word amongst the 300+ travellers was that somebody had jumped in front of the train ahead of us. This happens more regularly then you would think. I then had to wait over an hour for a mates dad to come and pick us up from a station in the middle of nowhere.An added bonus is that my office is relocating from the CBD to Milton, 1/2 way between the two train stations (Milton &amp; Roma St). So after 4 years of fighting it, I think I need to move to brisbane.I am toilet trained and looking for vacancies...</p>
