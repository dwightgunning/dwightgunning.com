<p>One thing that kind of annoyed me when I switched from Opera to Firefox was that there is only a single 'close tab' button that's displayed off on its own on the right hand side of the tab bar. I much prefered having a close button on each tab.I've been on a bit of a firefox extension binge today and just installed <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/785/">Tab X</a> which is takes care of my closee button gripe. It was created by <a href="http://clav.mozdev.org/">Stephen Clavering</a> who also has a few other extension that look neat.</p>
