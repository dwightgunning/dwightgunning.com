<p>Last night was the <a href="http://www.appsterdam.rs">Appsterdam</a> launch at the infamous bar Panama. The vibe was extremely positive and I really think we have a good thing going here.</p>
<p>The central point of the initiative is "information infrastructure" and improving communication amongst the app developer community.</p>
<p>First on the agenda is the Summer of Appsterdam which features the following (I think I got 'em all):</p>
<ul>
<li>Appsterdam Official Hangouts - places known as friendly to app developers.</li>
<li>Weekly Wednesday lunchtime lectures - meetups to teach and learn.</li>
<li>Family weekends - strengthening the community amongst family and friends</li>
<li>Community Outreach Interventions - connecting with locals, people and businesses, to show how new app innovations can be put to use.</li>
</ul>
<p>I took a recording with my phone (of course!). The audio quality actually isn't too bad so I've uploaded it: <a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/2748388/Appsterdam_launch_audio.amr">Appsterdam Launch audio</a>.</p>
