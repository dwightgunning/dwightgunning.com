<p>The book I'm currently reading, <a href="http://leananalyticsbook.com/">Lean Analytics</a>, explains what a Minimum Viable Vision (MVV) is and why founders should identify and be able to articulate their own.</p>
<blockquote><p>A minimum viable vision is one that captivates. It scales. It has potential. It's audacious and compelling. As a founder, you have to hold that huge, hairy, world-changing vision in one hand, and the practical, pragmatic, seat-of-the-pants reality in the other. The MVV you need in order to get funding demands a convincing explanation of how you can become a dominant, disruptive player in your market.</p></blockquote>
<p>The book prescribes thirteen elements which form a checklist and the authors say this can be used to determine whether your company is working on something that's potentially "big". These elements are detailed in theÂ <a href="http://www.yearonelabs.com/minimum-viable-vision/">original blog post</a>, upon which the chapter in the book is based.</p>
<p>It's curious that the authors chose to highlight fundraising as the reason know your MVV. To my mind there are other, better reasons to work out your MVV even before fundraising becomes a topic or even if you never seek external investment. With some tweaks, the MVV can be useful in attracting co-founders, employees, business partners, and potentially even launch customers and early adopters.</p>
<p>The first reason to spend time on an MVV is that it provides structure to the type of thinking that turns into loose daydreaming. Not that letting the mind wander occasionally isn't a necessary thing, but having a framework around which to focus will probably help stay on track and avoid repetitive thoughts and ideas, and ultimately wasted time.</p>
<p>Some additional elements to consider:</p>
<ul>
<li>Why does the company exist?</li>
<li>What makes you the best team to solve the problem?</li>
<li>How would customers otherwise solve their problem, what would they otherwise be doing while they use your product?</li>
<li>How will the company be physically located. Will development, marketing and sales, operations be centralised, regional, or distributed.</li>
<li>What are the key elements to the company culture?</li>

</ul>
<p>Google instilled the "don't be evil" thinking within the organisation to good effect.</p>
