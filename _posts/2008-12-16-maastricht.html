<p style="text-align: left">Maastricht, in the south of The Netherlands was a nice little one night detour.</p>
<p style="text-align: left">I didn't have a lot of time to see the sights, but went for a nice walk in the afternoon and managed to get a good feel for the place.</p>

<p style="text-align: left">Yet another river city with beautiful old buildings and lots of green areas. Maastricht is unique for it's abundance of university students (about 10% of the ~120,000 population).</p>
