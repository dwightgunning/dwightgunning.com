<p>So I've caved in and signed up for Facebook.You can find me under my name or by my email address: dwight@dwightgunning.comThe master plan is to rig something up so that posts here in the 'personal' category will somehow show up on Facebook.Rationale behind that I want to consolidate posts, journal type writing and general life updates on Stunt Show. Unfortunately my friends aren't really into RSS/ATOM and are much more likely to catch my updates on Facebook. I guess I need to mash it up a bit :-)</p>
