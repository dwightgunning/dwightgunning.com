<p>I'm a fan of Raymond Chen's blog, <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/default.aspx">The Old New Thing</a> because he often points out these subtle little things that I would have never thought about. One of his <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2005/08/22/454487.aspx">recent pieces</a>, raises a question about whether developers should be more accountable for how power hungry their code is.<br />
<blockquote>Nobody ever said, "Oh, yeah, I switched my word processor from X to Y because X was chewing too much battery power." When a battery doesn't last very long, users tend to blame the battery, not the software that is draining it.</p></blockquote>
<p>Being a bit of a greenie, I'm all for thinking in that direction... instead of producing larger capacity batteries that will run the most power-hungry applications for longer, why not just write apps that consume less.Anyway, the final thought goes to <a href="http://setiathome.ssl.berkeley.edu/">SETI@Home</a>. And especially to all the punters out there with their garage farms of old 486ers, left to run 24/7 at 99% cpu utilisation, on a quest to find ET.</p>
