<p>I mentioned to a mate a few weeks ago that lately I've been noticing more regular acquisitions within the tech industry. Maybe my radar is just a little bit better tuned in then it used to be? Probably a bit of both.Anyway, <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2005/06/28/sun_seebeyond/">The Register reports</a> that "Sun Microsystems is buying its way into the Service Oriented Architecture."Mark Baker <a href="http://www.markbaker.ca/2002/09/Blog/2005/06/28#deliciousdistobj.Smalltalk_Tidbi...bingo">suggests</a> that Sun might be buying more aggressively than it can sustain and agrees with <a href="http://www.cincomsmalltalk.com/blog/blogView?showComments=true&amp;entry=3297409537">sentiment</a> that any annoucement which contains 'SOA' should be taken with caution.Interesting stuff. There will be plenty more written.I guess the really important thing is that we stop talking up SOA and Web Services as a wonder cure for integration. Sure, it's an exciting and promising prospect and so its easy to evangelise. But at the same time it's a complex beast that involves careful consideration and planning while carrying its fair share of risk. We need to start selling the true story, which I think stands up on its own. People like <a href="http://www.coactus.com/blog">Mark Baker</a> and <a href="http://hinchcliffe.org/">Dion Hinchcliffe</a> are already doing a great job of this. I wanna learn more and join in.By the way, the Sun Press Release is <a href="http://www.sun.com/smi/Press/sunflash/2005-06/sunflash.20050628.5.html">here</a>.
