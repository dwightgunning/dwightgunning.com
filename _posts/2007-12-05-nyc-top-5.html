<p>Last December I went to New York for a few days. This was during one of my blogging hiatus so I never wrote anything about it at the time.Benny D., a good friend (who <a href="http://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=542223581">can be found</a> on FaceBook), is on his way there as we speak. Right before he left I got an SMS asking me to email him with some tips. Rather then do that I thought I'd post them here.So without delay... I present to you, in no particular order, my NYC Top 5:
<li><strong>Staten Island Ferry.</strong> Take the subway down to lower Manhatten and get lost amongst tall buildings in the financial district. See Federal Hall, the first capitol of the United States, on the corner of Nassau and Wall Street. Then wander around and check out the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall_Street_Bull">charging bull</a> on your way to the Ferry docks. It's free and gets you close enough to get a good look at the Statue of Liberty. The views from the ferry are pretty amazing.</li>
<li><strong>Central Park.</strong> It's big and it's green. Head to the park close to the end of your trip and you'll experience a really neat contrast. Walk towards the center, away from the traffic, for just a few minutes and you might forget you're in the middle of the city. The amazing skyline is the giveaway. I did this close to dusk one evening and it was pretty special.</li>
<li><strong>Madison Square Garden.</strong> Nothing too much was happening when I dropped in. Try and catch a game or concert if you can, I'm sure it'd be amazing to get inside. I just cruised around the foyer where there's some pretty cool memorabilia and a timeline of events that have been held there.</li>
<li><strong>Empire State Building</strong> An absolute must. Try and pick a clear day and arrive reasonably early to beat the inevitable queues. The view is unbelievable from the regular observation deck (no need to shell out extra for the higher deck if you ask me).</li>
<li><strong>Pizza... anywhere.</strong> Maybe in Greenwich Village or SoHo. I spent ages walking around these areas and found something interesting on literally every block.</li>
<p>Good times.</p>
