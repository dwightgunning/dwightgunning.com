<p>Eger is an easy and worthwhile day trip from Budapest; about two and half hours by train.I made the trip to see what Hungarian life is like outside of the capital. It was nice to see similarities in the peoples hospitality and the architecture around the place. The cleaner air and less crowded public spaces were also appreciated.The highlight of the day was probably relaxing in Dobo Istvan Ter (the main square) and watching the world go by.I also found and quite liked a monument to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungarian_Revolution_of_1956">1956 Hungarian Revolution</a>. It features an Uprising Flag which is essentially the Hungarian flag of today, with a hole torn from the center. The reason being that at the time the Hungarian flag featured a communist coat of arms. One of the revolutionaries ripped it out in protest and this action quickly spread. The site isn't listed in the Lonely Planet so for anybody interested, it's on the left hand side as you walk into town from the train station (on Hatvani Kapu tÃ©r, I think).As always, I've uploaded <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/dwightgunning/sets/72157608452223090/detail/">a few photos</a> which I hope everybody enjoys.</p>
