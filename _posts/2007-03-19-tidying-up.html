<p>I'm still tidying up after the move. I've used a couple plug-ins and guides that are worth mentioning because they've helped a lot and deserve the plug.I've created a <a href="http://feedburner.com">FeedBurner</a> account and wired up the RSS feed for this blog. There's a neat <a href="http://orderedlist.com/wordpress-plugins/feedburner-plugin/">WordPress plug-in</a> that guides you through the steps to configure things on the FeedBurner side as well as auto-magically redirecting requests to the standard WordPress feed url. Subscribing to the URL behind the <a href="http://www.dwightgunning.com/stuntshow/?feed=rss2">Entries (RSS)</a> link at the bottom of the page should work a treat.I also followed a <a href="http://underscorebleach.net/jotsheet/2006/05/move-blogger-to-wordpress">few simple steps</a> to get client-side redirects going on the old Blogger site. Somebody commenting on the instructions and said Google has flagged their blog as a spam-blog. Hopefully this won't be a problem for me.</p>
