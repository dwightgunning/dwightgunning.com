<p><a href="http://www.25hoursaday.com/weblog/PermaLink.aspx?guid=7334fd0c-6541-46a5-a38e-7aa69b3cfcb7">Dare says...</a><br />
<blockquote>I'm not sure I understand what Hugh means by Microsoft has opted to take the non-Cluetrain route but then again the entire Cluetrain trend is something I've never been too knowledgeable about.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.gapingvoid.com/Moveable_Type/archives/002955.html">Hugh's thinking</a> that Microsoft are heading down the path of 'extinction management'; trying to keep the walls up and impermeable to conversation. I don't see it that way. Maybe part of the organisation is on that track but there's definitely enough people within Microsoft who are engaged in <i>the conversation</i> to make me believe they'll pull through.Where Dare does miss the cluetrain bigtime is in his suggestion that handing over <a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/about.aspx">Channel 9</a> to "professionals" could be a good thing in the wake of Scoble's departure.<br />
<blockquote>It may even be a good thing to have some professional media folks running Channel 9 instead of just amateur media geeks.</p></blockquote>
<p>I haven't ever used Ch9 but whenever I've read about it, it seems like a cool place. Replacing the amatures will suck, the real users will see through it in a second and it is <b>so</b> not what the <a href="http://www.cluetrain.com">cluetrain</a> is all about.</p>
