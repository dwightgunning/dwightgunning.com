<p>This update comes in a little late since I've been side tracked with family (and general laziness) the past few days.The fourth weekend in December turned out to be a pretty interesting affair. I knocked off from work for the year on Friday and was extremely happy to make it home. The only thing I've taken with me is a 34 page form for some security access that I'll need in the new year. Oh, how much of a joy that's been to complete.Anywho, Friday night was a fairly low key event. I managed to get myself down to The Back Page for a few quiet beers with a mate. Toohey's Old was the beverage of choice; a long time favourite of mine from the cheaper/mass produced market.Saturday morning was quiet also, in the most part due to a solid sleep in that I desperately needed. I got my act together close to midday and had the best intentions of shooting the basketball before heading around to a christmas party being held by trio of friends who are sharehousing.I'd was about fired up the car when a call from mum threw plans into disarray. Being the good son, I offered my services to sort out a radiator issue down at the fruit and veg store. This was close to the bottle shop I had planned to visit so the distance/location wasn't such a problem for me. After 45 minutes in the sun working on the car and a recently purchased bottle of Malibu in hand, I gave up on the basketball and went straight to the party. It turned out to be a great afternoon by the pool and evening on the deck.Sunday morning I hit the shops early to purchase one last christmas present. This was wrapped by about 11:30 so I chilled out and played through the 'best of The Cure' album I'd bought myself earlier in the day. The afternoon drifted away to the sounds of the stereo and thoughts of the upcoming celebrations.</p>
