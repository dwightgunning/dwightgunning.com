<p><em>The assignment was to write your life story in four paragraphs with each paragraph describing one of the following: (1) early childhood, (2) schooling, (3) professional career, and (4) entrepreneurship...</em></p>
<p>I was born and spent my early years on the Gold Coast. I was into helicopters and lego. My parents had a restaurant/cafe which they had to close. The land across the road from my street was undeveloped, it had these huge sand dunes that my neighborhood friends and I used to play in after school.</p>
<p>Schooling started in a public school but I moved to a private school when I was about 10. My school started to mandate that every kid needed a laptop. We already had a 386 IBM Compatible at home but my first laptop was the best thing ever. I wrote a couple games using the LOGO language. One involved escaping from a labyrinth maze underneath a pyramid and the other was a single-level platform game called “Dunk” where the character would slam dunk a basketball.</p>
<p>I started my professional career with an internship at SAP Research while in my final year of a Bachelor of Information Technology. That gave me a foot in the door for Accenture’s graduate intake and I’ve been there since January 2005, relocating to The Netherlands in 2010. Around this time I rekindled an earlier interest in entrepreneurism and tech startups.</p>
