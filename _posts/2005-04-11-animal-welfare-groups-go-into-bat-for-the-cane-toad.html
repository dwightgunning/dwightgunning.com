<p>According to <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/newsitems/200504/s1342444.htm">this article</a>, welfare groups are angered at a Northern Territory parliamentary Minister's comments on cane toad irradication strategies.<br />
<blockquote>"We hit them with cricket bats and golf clubs and the like," he said."Back then things were a bit different, most kids had a slug gun or an air rifle and we'd get stuck into them with that sort of stuff."</p></blockquote>
<p>The thing I find amusing is that somebody in a position of authority would make suchh a statement to the media. You're clearly going for a triple backflip into hot-water.</p>
