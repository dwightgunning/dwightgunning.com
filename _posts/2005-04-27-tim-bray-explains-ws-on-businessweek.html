<p><a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing">Tim Bray</a> has a neat wrap-up of Web Services for the non-technical folks out there. Read it at <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/technology/content/apr2005/tc20050421_1855.htm">BusinessWeek</a>. I like his plug for <a href="http://rest.blueoxen.net/cgi-bin/wiki.pl">ReST</a> towards the end.</p>
