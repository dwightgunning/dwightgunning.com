<p><a href="http://blogs.osafoundation.org/mitch/000872.html">Mitch Kapor</a> points to a <a href="http://www.zdnet.com.au">ZDNet</a> article titled <a href="http://www.zdnet.com.au/news/security/0,2000061744,39183346,00.htm">Tracking PC's anywhere on the Net</a>. It's about a research in California who's working on tracking PCs on the net, behind firewalls, wherever, without them knowing it.<br />
<blockquote>The technique works by "exploiting small, microscopic deviations in device hardware: clock skews." In practice, Kohno's paper says, his techniques "exploit the fact that most modern TCP stacks implement the TCP timestamps option from RFC 1323 whereby, for performance purposes, each party in a TCP flow includes information about its perception of time in each outgoing packet. A fingerprinter can use the information contained within the TCP headers to estimate a device's clock skew and thereby fingerprint a physical device."</p></blockquote>
