<p>There's not all that too much to say about Amsterdam. I arrived Saturday evening and departed fairly early on the following Monday.The most humorous anecdote was when Matt and I had to drag a punter from one of canals at about 1am Sunday morning. Wes was too busy taking photos to lend a hand.The guy had fallen in on the other side of the canal. Unfortunately I only saw the splash. From what Matt described, it involved him stumbling backwards in a drunken stupor and tripping on a bicycle. A very Amsterdam moment indeed.What was interesting from there was that I think the guy actually took a liking to the water. It didn't seem like he was  at all interested in getting out as he casually swam in our general direction. This was despite the fact he was wearing a leather jacket, denim jeans and heavy boots.Those of us on dry land decided pretty quickly that his fun wasn't going to last. So we got down to the edge of the canal and pulled the guy up the meter or so to bring him onto the embankment. He mumbled something and then asked if any of us could spare a cigarette.Just to cap things off, as we walked away somebody had the presence of mind to start up a round of the Baywatch theme song. Here's the first verse in case you're ever in a similar situation:<br />
<blockquote>Some people stand in the darknessAfraid to step into the lightSome people need to help somebodyWhen the edge of surrenderâ€™s in sight.</p></blockquote>
