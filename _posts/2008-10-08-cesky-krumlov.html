<p>On advice from a number of friends, I had this small town in Southern Bohemia high on the list of places to see in the Czech Republic. It's a quiet spot (pop. ~14,000) but despite it's size there was plenty to do and a bunch of great people to meet.We arrived early and after dropping our bags we headed for breakfast at Cafe 99. Being a Monday morning the town was pretty much void of people. Coming from the crowds in Prague made this even more noticeable. The numbers picked up throughout our stay but judging by all the restaurants and their empty chairs, the high season has definitely passed for another year.One of the more interesting activities we undertook was a four hour rafting ride down the winding Vltava river. It was a leisurely trip without any real rapids or waterfalls in our way. The most excitement was navigating the three weirs on our course. A new friend from the hostel joined myself, Matt and Wes so we had plenty of paddelling power. Having a fourth person was also helpful when we 'beached' ourselves on the shallow rocky bottom.With so many restaurants, we were spoilt for choice. Standout meals were a bean burrito from a homely vegitarian place and chick/pork/lamb skewers in cavernous underground restaurant.The Krumlov Castle is an interesting attraction. It includes a rounded tower with elaborate paintwork, a large chalet, and a wide garden that's perfect for an afternoon stroll. On our last day, we paid up and took a tour of the inside of the Castle. Unfortunately the guide was a little robotic with her script so I was keen to finish up and hit the road/tracks for Krakow, Poland.</p>
