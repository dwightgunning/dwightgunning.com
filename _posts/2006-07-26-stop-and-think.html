<p>I can appreciate where Dare is coming from in his post about how <a href="http://www.25hoursaday.com/weblog/PermaLink.aspx?guid=3cec53ea-5de9-4931-8a45-fabac12d5453">Every Bad Decision Has a Good Reason Behind It</a>.Most of the time I try to understand, rationalise and sometimes question decisions made either before I arrived on my current project or more recently by other teams. In general I see this as being a fairly healthy habit since I'm really just trying to get a broader and deeper understanding of system we're building and to ensure that we make the right choices so the client gets the best result possible.One thing I've noticed though, and this is something I'm trying to be more alert to, is that I probably only recognise the likelihood of "Good Reasons" half of the time. It's way too easy to have a whinge to somebody close by about some seemingly ill-conceived decision without knowing all the the factors that have effected the final decision.I guess a lot of people are guilty of this to some degree (, maybe?). Anway this post can serve as a reminder to myself to stop and think about the good reasons that probably led to those 'bad' decisions.</p>
