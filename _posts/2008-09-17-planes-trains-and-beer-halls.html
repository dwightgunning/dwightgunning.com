<p>After 24+ hours travel, I've just ticked off a full twenty four hours in Munich. So far so good.The flights over were reasonable thanks mainly to the various Qantas and BA lounges I was lucky enough to gain entry into. During the flight to Singapore I kept myself amused by figuring out a Desktop Publishing application. After re-boarding and settling in for the cruise to London I caught a decent nights sleep before watching Casablanca in the early hours of Tuesday morning.I also happened made friends with a German bloke, Wolfgang, who had the seat next to me. He had a few interesting stories to tell and was on his way home to wrap up a few things before making a more permanent relocation to Canberra later in the year. I'm sure we'll keep in touch.Munich and Germany in general is such a great place to start the trip. There's a really good vibe from the other backpackers and the impending Oktoberfest action. The thing is that it has just the right amount of culture-shift on offer. Everything is just a bit more challenging than at home while at the same time it's very easy to just relax and enjoy. Highly recommended.After leaving the airport by train and arriving at the Central Station, I vaguely recalled the street our hostel is on from my last trip here in 2006. I walked a bit of a circle and eventually found the street and the hostel. With even more luck found Brad and Kate already milling around waiting for the 2pm check-in time to roll around. It was great to see a couple of familiar faces.We got settled and went out to find a late lunch. As one might imagine, this turned out to be a sausage and beer at the Hofbrau beer hall. Magic. Afterwards we cruised back to the hostel to wait for Matt and Wes to call me and announce their arrival The call never came but the boys did show up, much to my surprise. After exchanging the standard pleasantries, it was off the Augustiner beer hall for dinner and beers. A great night was had by all!No doubt there are plenty more great days and nights to reflect on in future posts.</p>
