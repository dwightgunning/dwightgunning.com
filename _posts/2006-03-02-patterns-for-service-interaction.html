<div>I read <a href="http://www.kleineikenscheidt.de/stefan">Stefan Kleineikenscheidt</a> who <a href="http://www.kleineikenscheidt.de/stefan/archives/2006/03/service-interaction-patterns.html">says </a> he reads the <a href="http://www.eaipatterns.com">EAI Patterns</a> and has spotted a site called <a href="http://www.serviceinteraction.com/">Service Interaction Patterns</a>.I hadn't seen the Service Interaction Patterns site before but it's created by some smart folks I used to work with so I had a close look around. The site has detailed descriptions, real world examples and Flash animations which are particularly helpful in visualising how common interactions take place.It should prove useful to anyone doing process interoperation through the firewall and across traditional organisational boundaries.</div>
