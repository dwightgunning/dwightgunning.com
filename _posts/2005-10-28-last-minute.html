<p>I've left everything 'til the last minute. I was going say 'as per usual' but I'm not sure that's really me. I'm supposed to be moving back up to Brisbane this morning after spending 4 or 5 weeks with my parents on the Gold Coast. This should be good.Only thing is I forgot to tell my parents that today is the day. The move has been on the cards for a while and I let mum know a few weeks back but I wasn't sure the exact day because both the flatmates-to-be and myself have had to juggle a few things. So Mum's in Adelaide and Dad's at work and I'm at home packing to leave.It's actually not that bad; I let Dad in on the plans last night and wrote down the address. That last paragraph was really just for emphasis. But that's not to say Mum won't spin-out when I call her later on and let her know I won't be here when she returns Sunday evening.Aside from giving Mum the good news, I have two other issues at hand. The first is that I promised I'd fix the soundcard on this machine, which I'm thinking is going to require a format and clean install of windows + apps. Right now, I need this like I need a hole in the head.The other issue is the sheer volume of clothes, cds, books and shit (mostly clothes, cds and books) that is spread across two of the five bedrooms under this roof. Having two equally messy rooms is a consequence of moving into a different bedroom to the one I was in previously, before I moved out for the first time in June. I think my subconscious made that decision in order to maximise the carnage. I've basically got one massive pile of clean clothes in one corner of my bedroom (the one I sleep in), and an equally large pile of dirty clothes in another. The other room has the cds, books and other personally effects which are somewhat ordered but I'm still not looking forward to packing it up and trying to fit it all in the mini.And all I really want to do is hit the beach.Bonus Track: <em>"The Last Minute"</em> by <a href="http://www.somethingforkate.com">Something for Kate</a>.<br />
