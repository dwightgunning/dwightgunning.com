<p>Since I've been thinking a bit more about service description and SDLs (I hope we're calling these 'saddles'), I took another look at <s>Jon Udel</s>'s <a href="">Joe Gregorio</a>'s (<i>updated 6/6</i>: I need to look at the By-line) article on Web Service Description for RESTful services, <a href="http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2005/04/06/restful.html">Constructing or Traversing URIs?</a>.I <a href="http://stuntshow.blogspot.com/2005/04/exposing-your-shiney-new-restful.html">talked-up</a> the article in April but what was interesting this time round was a comment linking to <a href="http://members.optusnet.com.au/benjamincarlyle/benjamin/blog/">Benjamin Carlyle</a> and his post <a href="http://members.optusnet.com.au/benjamincarlyle/benjamin/blog/2005/05/08#describingREST">Describing REST</a>. In it, he cans the approach to service description taken in the article, calling it "damn foolish." I'm going to need to think about a bit more before I decide what I think about it (long time readers may recognise this ruse since I rarely form opinions of my own).As an aside, looks like Benjamin's a Queenslander too. Cool.</p>
