<p>I have a couple ideas for software services, digital goods and also physical products that I'd like to release and sell online in 2013. The aim is to follow the Lean Startup method and iterate quickly to bring these to market, culling those that aren't viable along the way.</p>
<p>My first steps were to complete a lean canvas, define a customer architype, list out in bullet points the pains-gains and key attributes to my offering, noting any assumptions. From there I started talking to potential customers to test the offer and started to prepare a very early websites to make each offer feel real.</p>
<p>The aim was a lean website that is exceptionally cheap to create and run, requires no server setup or administration, and minimal coding. This ensures the focus stays on the customer and the product, not on technology.</p>
<p>Here is the formula:<br />
- Amazon S3 storage is perfect for quick and cheap hosting of fast and reliable static websites<br />
- LaunchRock and Mailchimp offer free widgets to embed for expression of interest or sign-up forms<br />
- Mixpanel has a free tier and enables funnel and segmentation analysis so an offering and site design can be refined and optimised<br />
- Django-Cactus is an open source static site builder that makes creating and deploying the website a snap<br />
- Twitter Bootstrap is very easy to use and even HTML/CSS beginners can design polished and professional looking sites<br />
- Google AdWords is the stardard for online advertising</p>
<p>With these 6 ingredients I believe anybody can build and release a unique, professional product website in under a day. The best part is the only upfront cost is purchasing a domain name and the only ongoing fees are from advertising and amazon storage.</p>
<p>The formula has allowed me to get a website off the ground quickly without getting distracted from the real priorities, refining the offer and talking to customers. I hope it can help out other new entrepreneurs looking to do the same.</p>
