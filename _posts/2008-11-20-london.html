<p>I flew through London mainly to link up some cheap flights between Europe and the Ireland. It also gave me the chance to catch up with a handful of friends who I haven't seen for far too long.I had no real tourist agenda except for the Tower of London which I had skipped on my only previous visit in 2006. The Yeoman Warder ("Beefeater") tour was informative and worth waiting around for. The armory exhibition in the White Tower was interesting to start with but after about 15 minutes I was looking for a quick way out.

<p>To be honest I spent more time than I would have like stressed out about where I would be staying in Cork. But I'll explain all that in another post.</p>
