<p>If I'm wrong here, please let me know.Technorati needs to make it easier to search a particular blog. I can search for words/phrases I've used in post here using the embedded Technorati box in the side bar (they provide a javascript which you paste into your blog template). If I want search another blog that doesn't have the search field then I'm stuck because there is no easy way in the <a href="http://www.technorati.com">Technorati</a> UI to specify that you want to search a particular blog.I think its a pretty important use case too. Often I think of a post that I've read in the past but can't remember exactly when, or what it was titled... I just know that it was published to a particular blog.Google supports this with the <a href="http://www.google.com.au/help/refinesearch.html">Domain Search</a> feature (put <i>site:</i> in front of the domain you want to search) but Technorati is the first search engine I think of when I want to search blogs so they need to make this easy for me.I think the update would be pretty simple. Next to the standard blog search field there's an 'Options' button that adjusts the UI to show some extra parameters like "contain all these words:", "contain this exact phrase:" etc. An extra field here that says <b>"from the Weblog at this URL:"</b> would suffice. All that needs to happen is the contents of the field be included in the request URL as a 'from' parameter. Just like this <a href="http://www.technorati.com/search/Technorati?from=http://stuntshow.blogspot.com">this</a></p>
