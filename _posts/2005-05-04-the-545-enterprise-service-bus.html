<p>I've come across the debate about ESB a little late in the piece and as such have had to wade through the back-and-forth blogging that's taken place over the last couple weeks. Hopefully I can straighten it out here.Deep in my search for answers I found an InfoWorld article from April 29th, <a href="http://www.infoworld.com/article/05/04/29/HNesb_2.html">What just is an ESB, anyway?</a> It's a 3-pager that lifts the lid on what some vendors offer as a product, and others simply describe as "a set of capabilities" making up part of the middleware stack. The first page has some interesting points but it turns out to be mainly quotes from vendors who have some vested interest. Perhaps that's why nobody else has tagged it on <a href="http://del.icio.us/dwightgunning/esb">del.icio.us</a> and <a href="http://www.technorati.com/cosmos/search.html?rank=&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.infoworld.com%2Farticle%2F05%2F04%2F29%2FHNesb_2.html">technorati</a> shows no inbound linking.So what is an ESB? In simple terms, its purpose is to provided messaging, service hosting and data format mediation amongst a series of Web Services, legacy apps, business processes that interact with the bus.Phil Wainwright declared the <a href="http://www.looselycoupled.com/blog/lc00aa00073.html">end of the road</a> for ESB last November. He had the following to say about integration issues that will arise with proprietary ESBs.<br />
<blockquote>What a misnomer it is to call this technology an enterprise bus when it seems that most enterprises will have several of them â€” if not dozens â€” each addressing a separate archipelago of integration.</p></blockquote>
<p>Although I don't have any real experience to back this up, I'm tending to agree with his sentiment that the Web service standards should provide all you need for successful integration across the enterprise.Some have also <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/richardt/archive/2005/03/23/401146.aspx">raised concerns</a> that ESBs are an at worst a vehicle for vendor lock-in, and at best encourage the attachment of dumb nodes to a smart network (a flaw characterised by the telcos and POTS, see <a href="http://www.isen.com/stupid.html">Rise of the stupid network</a> - I love the section title 'just send the bits, stupid'). Dave Chappelle, author of a book on ESBs and recipient of these criticisms <a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/wlg/6916">provides</a> a clear response and further explanation of the pro-ESB side of the coin.At this point, Wainewright again <a href="http://www.looselycoupled.com/blog/lc00aa00095.html">weighed into the debate</a> with more interesting insights.<br />
<blockquote>The implication is that some enterprises will be better off implementing their SOA using an ESB, while others should move directly to WS-Fabric.</p></blockquote>
<p>The transition from legacy systems and information islands to the loosely coupled -- tightly integrated utopia that technologists are pushing on the enterprise was never going to be easy or achieveable in one fowl swoop. With this in mind its pretty clear there are quick wins to be had through the adoption of an ESB which will bootstrap enterprise wide system integration. On the flip side, its concerning that vendors have much to gain from an emerging product space with great lock-in potential. Further, the side-stepping of the WS-* 'fabric' that is designed to negate the need for such middleware seems like a waste. Whatever. It's definitely a step in the right/general direction from a business perspective.To finish off, here's a couple more links...The wikipedia has a fairly thin <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enterprise_service_bus">article</a> but it does point at a comprehensive IBM Redbook, <a href="http://publib-b.boulder.ibm.com/Redbooks.nsf/RedpieceAbstracts/sg246346.html?Open">Implementing an SOA using an Enterprise Service Bus</a>. And lastly it was this <a href="http://weblog.infoworld.com/udell/2005/05/02.html#a1226">post</a> by Jon Udell that got me started thinking about ESB.</p>
