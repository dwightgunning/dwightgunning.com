<p>To those on the Gold Coast, I noticed on Sunday that there's a <a href="http://www.public.net.au/core.php?section=locations.php#QLD_BROADBEACH">WiFi hotspot</a> at the Oasis shopping center in Broadbeach.I'm not usually the one to sit in a cafe and sip latte's while tapping at a laptop but I'm tempted to try it out next weekend.Are there any others in the Brisbane/Gold Coast area?</p>
