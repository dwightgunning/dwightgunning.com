<p>Since the beginning of the year I've been doing a lot less coding at work. The result of taking up a team lead role.It's going fairly well and less time spent developing at work definitely has it's advantages.It means I start to get that desire to cut some code in my spare time. In the last month I've reacquainted myself with <a href="http://www.python.org">python</a> and thrown together a <a href="http://maps.google.com">g-maps</a> mash-up built with the <a href="http://www.djangoproject.com">Django Framework</a>. I've brought in <a href="http://www.dojotoolkit.org/">Dojo</a> for JavaScript and it's all buzzing nicely.The app I have is just a simple proof of concept at the moment. Before I go too far I want to get my head around some of the unit testing/tdd tools for Python and JavaScript. I've seen a few around the place while googling but I'd love to hear any recommendations.More updates on tdd with python to come.</p>
