<p>Last week was the start of a new role in Canberra. There were more airports, taxis and airplane food then generally desirable. I need to get used it quick because it's shaping up to be a standard part of my week for the next six months.Friday night was Brisbane and I took a CityCat around to the University of Queensland to see my sister Dana's graduation ceremony. This was my first time at such an event since I elected not to attend my own. Although the main attraction, Dana crossing the stage, took all of 5 seconds, the rest of the event was reasonably interesting and went quickly.Later in the evening I made my way through a couple bars in Brisbane and the Surfers Paradise.Saturday and Sunday were fairly identical: a decent sleep-in, beach, shopping for Christmas presents at Pacific Fair and catching up with friends in the evening. The difference being the all-grain home brewed beer on Saturday and the Boost Juice on Sunday. Good times.</p>
