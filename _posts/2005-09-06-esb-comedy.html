<p>Here's a funny <a href="http://kennyw.com/wp-images/blog/esbComic.bmp">comic</a> that takes a shot at ESB technology.Rich Turner, Indigo/WCF guru, <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/richardt/archive/2005/07/21/441476.aspx">blogged it</a> a couple weeks ago but it only just showed up in my aggregator. His <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/richardt/">blog</a> is definitely worth checking out.</p>
