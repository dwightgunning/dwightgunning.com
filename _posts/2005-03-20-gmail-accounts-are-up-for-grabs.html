<p>Anybody who's keen for a <a href="http://www.gmail.com">gMail</a> account, let me know because I have some invites to handout. Leave your email address here, or email me and I'll set you up :-)<i>An Aside:</i>gMail uses Microsoft's <code>XMLHttp</code> ActiveX object and Firefox's equivalent, the <code>XMLHttpRequest</code> object. This is a problem for <a href="http://www.opera.com">Opera</a> users, as neither are implemented in the current stable release, 7.54u2. The good news is that the upcoming 8 series has support and <a href="http://www.opera.com/download/?ver=8.0b3">beta3 is available for download</a>!</p>
