<p>This guy is <i>really</i> <a href="http://www.zedshaw.com/blog/programming/programmer_stats.html">pissed off</a> with programmers who don't appreciate statistics.<br />
<blockquote>This article is my call for all programmers to finally learn enough about statistics to at least know they donâ€™t know shit. I have no idea why, but their confidence in their lacking knowledge is only surpassed by their lack of confidence in their personal appearance.</p></blockquote>
<p>Interesting reading. But I'd say it's not just a matter of knowing that one doesn't know shit... its about balancing when to admit you know shit in order to learn from those who know their shit... and when to make broad generalisations to those who don't know shit either so that you so you don't end up in the shit later on.|Update|I think <a href="http://www.zedshaw.com/blog">Zed Shaw</a> is pissed off other things too, including <a href="http://www.zedshaw.com/blog/programming/indirection_is_not_abstraction.html">indirection</a><br />
<blockquote>I hate it even more when someone beats me over the head with words they were handed in some rhetoric class masquerading as a computer science course. Words like â€œabstractâ€?, â€œpatternâ€?, and â€œobject orientedâ€? are used like a shield to protect the implementer from critical words like â€œcrapâ€?, â€œcomplicatedâ€?, â€œobtuseâ€?, and â€œannoyingâ€?.</p></blockquote>
<p>I find his writing style very compelling.</p>
