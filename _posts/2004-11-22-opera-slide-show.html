<p>This morning I went to check out <a href="http://bitworking.org/news/XML_2004_Review">Joe Gregorio's XML Review</a> slides which he mentioned were published in the new and cool-sounding (name and purpose) S<sup>5</sup>.</p>
<p>First impression was... what the hell is Opera doing with this page??? It rendered a single page with Zero formatting. So I took a look at the <a href="http://www.meyerweb.com/eric/tools/s5/">S<sup>5</sup> overview</a> and it says its compliant with Opera Show... what is that? A quick google and it turns out that Opera Show is enabled simply by going full screen - F11. This now renders the slides properly and you can control the slide show with keys PgUp/PgDn keys. Try it on the <a href="http://www.opera.com/support/tutorials/operashow/">Opera Show Tutorial</a>, it looks pretty powerful. I've been using Opera for 3 years and I didn't know this feature existed. Call me stupid. But it would be really nice if Opera alerted me to the fact that the page I'm browsing is actually an Opera Show and I should check it out by going full screen.</p>
<p>I wonder how many slide show's I've missed because I didn't know they were show's and Opera didn't let me know? Probably not many because its a format that only Opera supports... but with S<sup>5</sup> being nice and 'open', there should be more.</p>
<p>Aside: yes this is my first blog entry. The name of this blog entry and the name of the blog are completely coincidental  I came up with the name 'stunt show' about 3 weeks ago and was planning to start blogging then. But I got busy with work &amp; also wanted to avoid the initial "look at me I'm a blogger post" until I found a suitable topic to talk about. More about me later on...</p>
