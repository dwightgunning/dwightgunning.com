<p><a href="http://www.mozilla.org/products/thunderbird/">Thunderbird 1.0</a> has been released and is a cracker email client.</p>
<p>I've dabbled with <a href="http://www.opera.com">Opera</a>'s <a href="http://www.opera.com/products/desktop/m2/">inbuilt email</a>, used Outlook 2003 at work, and eventually succumbed to my ISP's web-based mail client. I've been looking break free from this nasty webmail world for a while, but got caught up dreaming about a running a mail proxy on my LANs webserver and never got around to it. TB has a couple of good things going for it:</p>
<ul>
<li>A built in spam filter that learns as you use the client. I have a feeling it uses one of the OSS spam filters that are available, such as <a href="http://spamassassin.apache.org/">SpamAssassin</a></li>
<li>Its a stand alone application so I can do email when I wanna do email and not be interrupted when I'm browsing.</li>
<li>Built in RSS. The built in RSS looks like it works a bit better than Opera's RSS facility. Opera doesn't render the html that some feeds include in the items. No doubt Opera's RSS will improve in the next release, the browser companies are only just coming online with RSS support.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Two things that suck:</p>
<p>With the linux download you get a text file saying:</p>
<blockquote><p>For information about installing, running and configuring Thunderbirdincluding a list of known issues and troubleshooting information,refer to: http://getthunderbird.com/releases/</p></blockquote>
<p>It turns out there's no information about installing, running or configuring TB on this page... just a little hyperlink to <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/products/thunderbird/releases/">Release notes</a>. In my experience the 'release notes' are aimed at developers or advanced/long-time users who want to know what's new to this particular version. The newbies want an 'installation instructions' page.</p>
<p>The other thing is really annoying: the date column. Dates are shown in the US format of mm/dd/yyyy and I can't handle that. Nor should I have to. Whats worse is that the setting to change it (I expect there to be one somewhere) is not immediately obvious from looking at the normal locations; the preferences dialog, account settings etc.</p>
<p>The pluses outweigh the sucky things, so its all good. TB wins for price, interface, speed and stability as well as being a standalone appy which I appreciate. I'll check Opera's RSS support next release &amp; may switch back but for now the Thunderbirds are GO!</p>
