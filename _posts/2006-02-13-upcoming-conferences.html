<div>I won't be able to attend  <a href="http://www.waterfall2006.com/">Waterfall 2006</a> but it looks like it will be a cracker.On a more serious note, the  <a href="http://2006.middleware-conference.org/">Middleware</a> gig is on in Melbourne later this year (Nov/Dec).  <a href="http://www.markbaker.ca/2002/09/Blog/2006/02/07#2006-02-mw2006-cfp">Mark Baker</a> always seems to make a lot of sense and he's on the committee so I'm thinking it will be worth travelling for.</div>
