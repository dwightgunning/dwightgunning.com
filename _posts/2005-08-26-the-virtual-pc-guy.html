<p>As I mentioned previously I've got Ubuntu running on a virtual machine, today I went googling to figure out how to get the networking going and found the <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/virtual_pc_guy/default.aspx">Virtual PC Guy's Weblog</a>.Aside from being an interesting read, it proves the point I made to a colleague over lunch about how blogs are about conversations and interactions. They allow customers and potential customers to permeate large organisations and get reliable information directly from the source. This is far more satisfying than being fed info through the catch-all helpdesk and unidirectional PR/marketing channels. I suggested he join <a href="http://www.cluetrain.org/">the cluetrain</a>.</p>
