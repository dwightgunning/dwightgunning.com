<p>A couple of weeks ago I found <a href="http://www.itwire.com.au">IT Wire</a>, a pretty decent Aussie tech news site.Recently, I've had a few interesting conversations with colleagues and friends about how hot the contractor market is in Canberra at the moment, An article from today, <a href="http://www.itwire.com.au/content/view/5483/50/">High-end IT jobs demand spike</a>, suggests the ICT sector is performing pretty well overall.Let the good times roll :-)</p>
