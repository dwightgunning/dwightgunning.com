<p>I made it to Japan without too many hassles. Everybody here is great, the Japanese are such friendly people. I`m staying at a lovely place called <a href="http://www.lerch.co.jp/en/index.html">Lerch Lodge</a>. It has one of the original Apple iMac`s in the foyer with some sort of broadband internet access... free. Saves me going and finding an Internet Cafe. The room I have is traditional Japanese style, you slide the coffee table out of the way &amp; fold the bedding out at night; reversing the proceedure in the morning.I've been out on the snowboard for about 6 hours total and I'm getting the hang of it pretty well. We'll see how I hold up when I go out with the boys tomorrow. It's New Years Eve so everybody is buzzing and keen to party tonight. What is everybody doing to celebrate??? Apparently the whole town of Niseko congregates at the top car park next to the slopes which has heated bitumen. There should be plenty of beer &amp; no fear of it going warm. Air temp seems to average about -12 celsius. Cold enough for me.Best Wishes for the New Year!!!</p>
