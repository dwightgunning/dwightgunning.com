<p>I'm fairly sure the plan (if you could call it one) for Pilsen was hatched in the Lowenbrau tent on the first day of Oktoberfest. Andy and Tim had hired a car in Germany and said they had a great time driving down to meet us in Munich. I was sure we could have similar fun driving out to Pilsen and then on to Cesky Krumlov for a few days. It turns out I was mistaken.We picked up the Renault from a rental agency in the middle of town. After arranging a GPS we chose Jane, an English woman, to be our guide.This was my first time driving on the right and going from an old mini to a shuttle-like people mover made things quite tricky. The rain and congestion on the roads meant the difficulty level was pretty much set at 'ludicrous' right from the start.The first merge into traffic took place in third gear. The second started out in first gear but when going for the up-shift I nearly opened my door. This was met with nervous laughter from the passengers but at least we were on our way.Despite a few other minor difficulties, we eventually made it to Pilsen. Since it was already early evening we grabbed a meal and set about finding some nightlife. The Italian restaurant was noteworthy for the unchilled Pilsener Urquell. The night, mainly spent in a local karaoke bar, was memorable for a short Czech guy belting out What a Wonderful World.The only item on the agenda for Thursday was the Pilsener Urquell brewery. On arrival we noted that the malting aroma, and the site itself is much nicer than the XXXX factory at Milton.The tour was fairly involved, with a guide, bus rides, lots of stairs etc. As it was my fourth brewery tour, I knew pretty much what to expect. Aside from tour staples like the "how beer is made" video, the kettles, and bottling, there were a few unique things to keep me interested. We were taken down into the winding cellars that have been around since the early days of the brewery. An old video of the Coopers at work constructing the traditional timber beer barrells was another.The trip out to Pilsen was a mission but we survived. And I'm certainly glad we did it!Cesky Krumlov went on hold but I eventually made it. There'll be more on that South Bohemian gem later.</p>
