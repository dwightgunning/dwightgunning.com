<p>I just found out that there's an <a href="http://www.ideasfestival.com.au">Ideas Festival</a> in Brisbane at the end of March. A couple of the sessions look quite interesting:<strong>Wednesday 29 March</strong><br />
<blockquote><i>Ideas Debate 2006- Big ideas are better</i>Are they? What about the sneaky little ideas that change your life? Do only big ideas make an impact? National and international Ideas guests Cory Doctorow, Helen Stacy, Allan Luke, Larissa Behrendt, Frank Furedi and Pat Hoffie take sides. Debate adjudicator Phillip Adams controls the watch and the bell, but can he control them?</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Friday 31 March</strong><br />
<blockquote><i>Fighting the future</i>Technology columnist Cory Doctorow has long questioned whether we should fight the future. Online, at school, and at the UN, he has argued that proposed entertainment industry law reforms are bad for society, bad for industry and bad for freedom.</p></blockquote>
<p><Strong>Sunday 2 April</strong><br />
<blockquote><i>Desperately seeking sleep</i>Very few are getting enough. Children are struggling to learn, parents are dozing off, workers are worn out and all at a time when creativity, inspiration and energy are called for. Sleep expert Jill Dorrian joins insomniac Phillip Adams to see how we can get more sleep.</p></blockquote>
<p>I've listened to a few podcasts featuring <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cory_Doctorow">Cory Doctorow</a> so I'm looking forward to catching one of his sessions in Brisbane. I also need more/better quality sleep so hopefully I'll learn something there.</p>
