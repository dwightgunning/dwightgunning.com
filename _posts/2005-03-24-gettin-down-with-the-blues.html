<p>Last night I went and checked out <a href="http://www.guydavis.com/">Guy Davis</a>. He's in the area for the East Coast <a href="http://www.bluesfest.com.au/">Blues &amp; Roots Festival</a> at Byron Bay this weekend. Who is he? I didn't really know either but my parents said he'd be great to see. They weren't wrong. I guess you would say Guy is a second generation bluesman. He's got a great voice for singing the blues and a pretty solid sense of humor to go along with it. The gig was broken into two sessions, both starting out with slower and more mellow tunes before building up in pace and intensity towards the end. I snared an autograph for the folks during the interval.<a href="http://www.thesoundlounge.com.au">The Sound Lounge</a> is a pretty groovy little venue that is part of the Currumbin RSL. It's a poker machine haven for retired servicemen, senior citizens and alcoholics. There were probably about 150 or so people and a low stage so the vibe was excellent. I took a few mates who understand good music and they all appreciated the experience.There were a couple of things that annoyed me about the place (and don't worry I'm aware that every post on this blog ends up being a rant about something I don't like). There was a temporary black backdrop to the stage but it didn't go all the way to the roof, leaving a big flurescent Exit sign exposed right above Guy. Very Distracting. Also the doorway to kitchen was pretty prominent, letting light flood into the room every minute who so when staff came in/out. I was sitting pretty close to it so I'll give them the benefit of the doubt of the doubt on that one.All up it was a crackerjack evening, beers and tunes are where it's all at. I'll be keeping an eye out for other events at the Sound Lounge and definitely making my way through my fathers blues collection.</p>
