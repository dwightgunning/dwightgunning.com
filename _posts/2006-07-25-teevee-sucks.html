<p>I remember a speech I made for a compulsory public speaking competition at school when I was about 12. I took the stance that "TV sucks" and argued that the rest of the kids didn't really need it. The talk was serious but I still watched my fair share of teevee and had no intention of giving it up... I just figured it would be a good way to rev up my audience.I only just remembered that speech; it's certainly not something I've conciously reflected on through my late teens and early twenties. Just now though, I'm wondering if it may have instilled some subconcious desire to avoid television. Over the last 12 months I've pretty much stopped watching teevee.At my previous house, my last housemates and I started out with no teevee. This lasted for about a month until the couple I was living with decided they needed something to do and borrowed a real small box from a family member. A couple months later this was replaced with a big flatscreen. The initial moving in period was the first time I really decided that I couldn't be bothered with teevee although in honesty, once there was a box in the house, I did enjoy watching every now and then.Since moving in with my current set of housemates in April, we've had no real television in the house. We dragged my flatmates tiny little thing downstairs for the world cup last month but aside from that I haven't done any serious teevee watching at all. The stereo gets a heavy workout and there's scrabble, backgammon, chess boards on hand.I'm pretty happy with the conversation, music, boardgames, broadband.<br />
