<p>The Mess Hall gig last Friday @ The Zoo was solid gold ladies and gentlemen. To those who were in the crowd, outstanding work! We went off, they went off, I had such a good time. I'm kinda dark that they're not bringing out their album until later this year, but I will wait. We started in Dooley's, the local Irish pub. Then we went and had a pizza at a pseudo-italian restaurant, saw the band (no ear plugs was a big mistake) and then ended up back at Dooley's for a few more hours.It was good to finally let go of work after putting in a couple of big weeks (and weekends). The consultancy caper definitely ebbs and flows. It's also hard getting used to sitting on a different type of office chair every few weeks. Some are really bad!!!</p>
