<p>Jon Udell: <a href="http://www.infoworld.com/article/05/07/27/31OPstrategic_1.html">GreaseMonkey in Crisis</a>I've uninstalled <a href="http://greasemonkey.mozdev.org/">GreaseMonkey</a> until a full fix is available. I hope its soon cause its a great little plug-in that I use it all the time. Keep an eye on the <a href="http://greaseblog.blogspot.com">GreaseBlog</a> for updates.</p>
