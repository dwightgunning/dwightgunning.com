<p>Opera 8 <a href="http://www.opera.com">has been released.</a> I'm not using it to publish this post because it mucks up the rendering of this post-entry page. There is a hyperlink that switches the text-area into a 'preview' view. This is all broken and when I press ctrl-shift (like I do before I press the left/right keys to select a few words) it clears the textfield and I lose my post. Bummer.I really wanna start using <a href="http://del.icio.us">del.icio.us</a> more effectively but I don't really wanna do so via the web interface. So I'm thinking about trying firefox again. Has anybody had a go of the del.icio.us <a href="http://delicious.mozdev.org/">toolbar plugin</a>??? If you have, let me know what you think of it.</p>
