<p>Just earlier I was lying in bed, trying to get some sleep before the Australia Vs Italy game that's on later tonight. I was thinking how I need to get my act together and start a bit of a project and try make a few extra dollars for beer money or whatever. I've got a bit of an idea but I seriously don't know how it might pan out.Anyway, I kind of had this moment of clarity where I just said "fuck it, who cares if its a failure... the first business always fails." I dunno how true that a statement that really is but over the last couple months I've kind of decided I should stop waiting for the perfect business idea to come into my head and just start something. The web is so damn big and there's so many people out there that even that targets a real niche can work out. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_effect">Network</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Long_Tail">Long Tail</a> effect... yada, yada, yada.So I got outta bed and went and made myself a trusty toasted cheese/Vegemite sandwich and turned on the laptop. First stop, as usual, was the news aggregator and I found that Brad Feld's been <a href="http://www.feld.com/blog/archives/001772.html">talking about failure</a> too. Some of the comments are equally motivating.</p>
