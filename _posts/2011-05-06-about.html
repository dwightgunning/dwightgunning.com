<h2>The Author</h2>
<p>When asked, I've taken to describing myself as a tech adventurer. I find this best explains my love of both travel and technology, and my mission in life to explore and push limits in both.</p>
<p>I grew up on the <a title="Gold Coast, Queensland" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_Coast,_Queensland" target="_blank">Gold Coast</a> and spent a much time in or near the surf. I took a Bachelor of Information Technology (Software Engineering) before interning at <a title="SAP Research" href="http://www.sap.com/corporate-en/innovation/research/index.epx" target="_blank">SAP</a> and eventually working as a technology consultant for <a title="Accenture" href="http://accenture.com" target="_blank">Accenture</a>, based in Brisbane. I travelled much during this period for work and leisure including ten months commuting inter-state for work, as well as backpacking through SE Asia, Japan, the US and Europe.</p>
<p>It was on one such trip I met my girlfriend and subsequently moved to <a title="Amsterdam, Noord-Holland" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amsterdam" target="_blank">Amsterdam</a> at the beginning of 2010.</p>
<p>Since arriving I've become quite involved in the startup scene. This began as I attended and eventually started helping to organise <a title="Startup Weekend" href="http://startupweekend.org" target="_blank">Startup Weekends</a>. In 2011 I participated in the <a href="http://fi.co" target="_blank">Founder Institute</a> and founded <a href="http://revirda.com" target="_blank">Revirda</a> to help taxi drivers to drive less, and earn more.</p>
<p>With I'm not at work or travelling, I enjoy running, shooting hoops, listening to music and enjoying a night out with friends.</p>
<h2>The Website</h2>
<p>The Stunt Show, a blog, started back in November 2004. The title is borrowed from a great track by <a href="http://somethingforkate.com">Something For Kate</a>. I moved it from Blogger across to a shared hosting provider and WordPress in early 2006. Posts are generally technical/professional or personal musings about life in general.</p>
