<p>In England, the Catholic church is <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/newsitems/200505/s1379903.htm">advertising</a> in pubs to try and attract new priests and what not.It reminds me of the "Catholicism Wow!" campaign featuring <a href="http://ship-of-fools.com/Gadgets/Autos/108.html">'Buddy Christ'</a> that from Kevin Smith's <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120655/"><i>Dogma</i></a>. I find it hard to take seriously.Some of my mates are backpacking through the UK so I'll see if we can scoop some photographic evidence.</p>
