<p>The user interface has undergone a few subtle improvements after the major overhaul that was seen in version 7. I'm posting this from my 7.54u1 install as Blogger's post editor caused  8.0 bork. So there's obviously some work still to be done. I did noticed that the javascript toolbar in the editor had a few more HTML tag insertion options for <b>bold</b>, <i>italic</i>, etc which I don't get on 7.54 under linux or windows, so perhaps they're implementing some more IE extensions.On the topic of using an alternative browsers; I'm dissapointed with having to use IE for all intranet sites at work. There's heaps of ASP and wacky javascript making it impossible to use anything but IE. Not only do the sites render incorrectly (I could deal with that alone), but many of the links and mouse-over menu's are totally broken.</p>
