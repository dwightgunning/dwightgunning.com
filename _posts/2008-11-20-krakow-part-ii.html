<p>After spending a week in Hungary, I took a train back up to Krakow see about a girl (further explanation in a later post; perhaps). It was also a chance to try <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierogi">pierogi</a> and see the Wawel castle which I missed on the first pass.Another neat spot that we came across was an old, disused limestone quarry that has transformed itself into a lake. It's not far from residential areas and main roads but you feel like you're out in the country side. Apparently you can swim in it in the warmer months.
