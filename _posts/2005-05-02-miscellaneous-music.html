<p>Friday night I attempted to go see <a href="http://www.sarahblasko.com">Sarah Blasko</a>. It was a last minute decision that turned pear shaped. A friend from work was keen but had no support so I said I'd tag along and we'd make a night of it. As it turned out, the gig was sold out (and had been since earlier in the week according another mate). I was very bummed about that but I'll catch up with Sarah in July at <a href="http://www.splendourinthegrass.com">Splendour in the Grass</a>.And what a big month July is shaping up to be. Birthday festivities will be scaled-back this year because Yatesy (a mate with whom I share a birth date and a love of beer) is in Europe. In anycase, there'll be some serious celebration on the first weekend in July. You're invited so keep it free. Sortly after, the <a href="http://www.hotsnakes.com/">Hot Snakes</a> begin their <a href="http://www.shock.com.au/news/news_item.asp?news_ID=1078">Aussie Tour</a> in Brisbane. I am super keen for the gig at <a href="http://www.thezoo.com.au">the Zoo</a> and will definitely be making plans for a  road-trip (read: <a href="http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Fear_and_Loathing_in_Las_Vegas">flat-out high speed burn</a>) to see the Sydney show on Saturday the 9th. These boys are shit-hot so do yourselves a favour and get hold of <i>Automatic Midnight</i>, <i>Suicide Invoice</i>, <i>Audit in Progress</i>, and most recently the <i><a href="http://dagger138.blogspot.com/2005/04/hot-post.html">Peel Sessions</a></i>. You can all have the 3rd and 5th weekends off, but the 23rd and 24th is Splendour so your availability and attendance is most definitely required.Finally I should mention that the <a href="http://www.wolfmother.com">WolfMother</a> show on Sunday night was pretty ace. Nothing like some good, heavy Sabbath/Zeppelin inspired rock 'n roll to shake your bones and make sure you achieve as little as possible on a monday public holiday.Ohhh and here's one more gem I just noticed. Previously unreleased At The Drive-in material <a href="http://www.shock.com.au/news/news_item.asp?News_ID=1071">will be released</a> in May. I'm drooling... there's so much to look forward to in the next few months, I'd better not get hit by a car or something messed up like that.</p>
