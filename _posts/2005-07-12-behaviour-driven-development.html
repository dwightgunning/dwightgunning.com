<p>As I've mentioned previously, I've been trying to follow the principles of TDD (Test Driven Development) in a side-project that I have going which is based on the Eclipse RCP. Working with such a large and complex 'UI framework' is giving me a few headaches when it comes to writing tests but I won't get into these right now.What I wanted to point out is that <a href="http://daveastels.com/index.php?p=5">Dave Astel</a> has just recently posted a piece calling for a shift in thinking amongst TDD practitioners, suggesting only 5-10% actually get the fact that TDD isn't really about testing. He says the focus should be on specifying <i>behaviours</i>.<br />
<blockquote>When you realize that itâ€™s all about specifying behaviour and not writing tests, your point of view shifts. Suddenly the idea of having a Test class for each of your production classes is rediculously limiting. And the thought of testing each of your methods with its own test method (in a 1-1 relationship) will have you rolling on the floor laughing.</p></blockquote>
<p>Without being a TDD guru myself, I think these are important lessons that I'm gonna try and learn from and put into practice.
