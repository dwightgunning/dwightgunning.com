<p>I'm finishing a two week course that takes somebody who's never coded before and turns them into somebody who can code reasonably well in VB.Net. Super. I like the WYSIWIG user interface designer that Visual Studio .NET offers but I don't like my chances of decyphering the code it autogenerates. I don't know if I'm missing something but .NET seems to have Zero in the way of refactoring support aside from Find &amp; Replace. Eclipse has this well and truly covered, which makes me Smile when I tweak a little Java code on the commute to/from work.At the moment I'm working on a little application to rip images from my digital camera, store them in a decent heirarchy on the file system, as well as some maintaining some metadata about the image properties (exposure, auto-focus, lighting adjustment etc) and user related details (category, an event, people/subjects in the photo etc). I'm just toying with some imaging API's for the moment but I should start to play with <a href="http://www.openrdf.org">Sesame</a> and the <a href="http://www.eclipse.org">Eclipse</a> rich client platform soon enough.</p>
