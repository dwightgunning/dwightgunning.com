<p style="text-align: left">
<p style="text-align: left">After an overnight train from Berlin I had two busy days experiencing Belgium.</p>
<p style="text-align: left">We checked into our Antwerp hostel quite early, surprising and confusing the manager to the point of receiving a free breakfast. After that I decided not to waste any time and basically went straight back to the main train station to make my way to Brugges for the day.</p>
<h3>Brugges</h3>
<p style="text-align: left">This bustling seaside town lived up to it's reputation. It wasn't long before I found myself drooling on chocolate shop windows and inside cafes sampling Trappist and Abbey beers. I also found my favorite manhole cover for the trip:</p>

<h3>Ghent</h3>
<p>Next day I went out to Ghent. Kind of a mistake since it was a public holiday and there weren't many people around and even less shops open for business. I managed to completely underestimate the size of the place which led to a few navigation errors (read: being completely lost). But it was nice a fairly nice day and we had most of city to ourselves.

<h3>Antwerp</h3>
<p>With only two full days to see Belgium, I only really spent my evenings in Antwerp. I didn't see too much to be honest but from what I spotted, it's a decent place.My best memory is of an excellent modern blues-jazz band that we stumbled across in a smallish bar not far from the hostel. The four-piece featured a charasmatic Dutchman on vocals and lead guitar plus a Belgian who ripped on the harmonica. They played two sets thoughout the night plus a brief encore which only just managed to appease the crowd. I just wish I wrote down their name.</p>
