<p>For anybody interested, the Malyasian Department of Environment publishes an <a href="http://www.jas.sains.my/jas/Air+Pollutant+Index.htm">Air Polutant Index listing</a>.I'm heading to Kuala Lumpur in under a fortnight and I guess I'm not really looking forward to the <i>unhealthy</i> breathing that's currently on offer. Hopefully it'll clear up a little but apparently June-October is the worst time of the year for pollution, often due to fires in Indonesia. Anyway, aside from the air quality, I'm sure everything else will be great.And by the way, there's also <a href="http://www.epa.qld.gov.au/projects/air/index.cgi?category=1&amp;mode=index&amp;day=29&amp;month=08&amp;year=2005&amp;hour=15&amp;format=">a listing for Brisbane</a> on the Environmental Protection Agency website.* The two listings use different scales, so direct comparisons are tricky.</p>
