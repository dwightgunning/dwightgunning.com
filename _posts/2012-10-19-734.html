<p>I haven't read the 1000 page report but I guess there must be more sophisticated parts to the story than a guy on a moped called 'MotoMan' and the use of empty coke cans to dispose of the physical evidence.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>Just because there were so many people involved in the cheating over such a long period doesn't necessarily mean it has to have been sophisticated. It seems equally likely that testing program and the way it was governed at the time was either inadequate, flawed, corrupt, or some combination of all three.</p>
<p>Whatever; I feel let down as a sports fan and I can't imagine how all those cancer patients and survivors feel about their hero. It's just sad.</p>
