<p>I'm lying around listening to a couple CDs I bought yesterday (Pixies and She Wants Revenge). I just had a flashback to new year's day when I stumbled into a second hand record store and found The Answer To Both Your Questions by Something For Kate.I usually check the SFK spot in a vein attempt to find <a href="http://www.sfkforthenovice.com/release_detail.php?id=19">Intermission</a> which is rare.I couldn't remember whether the tracks are on Q&amp;A With Dean Martin, which I own. I didn't make the purchase. It turns out the vague memory was correct - Q&amp;A includes The Answer... and the tracks released with their first single Dean Martin.While googling and ended up on a tangent when I noticed the Prickly re-mix (of Prick) was by Eli Janney. He played bass/keyboards for <a href="http://www.gvsb.com/">Girls Against Boys</a>. Cool band in mind, mainly for the track 'Kill the Sex Player' from the Kevin Smith film Clerks.<br />
<blockquote>Kill that noise,Kill the noise.Make it alright,Kill the drummer.Kill the bass player,Kill both bass players.This song is so hip right now,I'm going deaf, I wanna kill the singer.</p></blockquote>
<p>Anyway, I think I'm going to buy The Answer to Both Your Questions.</p>
