<p>One of my mates from work had some serious laptop trouble last week; the hard drive was replaced. As a result he lost his bookmarks and asked me if I've seen or heard of any service that allows you to store your bookmarks online so you can access them anyway.Straight away I said <a href="http://del.icio.us">del.icio.us</a> but I think the tagging thing threw him out a little. I will persist with that. For now, does anybody know of anything that offers more traditional, category based online bookmarks?FYI, I've been through and had a pretty serious tidy up of my account, <a href="http://del.icio.us/dwightgunning">http://del.icio.us/dwightgunning</a>. I'm also going to force myself to use/rely on it more, and especially the <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=U&amp;start=1&amp;q=http%3A//delicious.mozdev.org/&amp;ei=mgifQqiSI8je4QGux8DuBA">firefox plugin</a>, by deleting all the reference and historical links from my local bookmark folders. I'm only leaving links to sites I hit everyday, online banking, news, weather, etc. This should be interesting.</p>
