<p>South East Queensland endured another round of pretty severe storms last night. As I stepped off the train on the Gold Coast I had to give some serious thought to the possibility my car may have been blown somewhere across to the other side of the carpark.Anyways, during the blackout that kicked in shortly after I made it home, I listened to a <a href="http://www.venturevoice.com/2005/08/vv_show_10_-_br.html">podcast interview</a> with <a href="http://www.feld.com/blog/">Brad Feld</a>. In the interview he discusses how he and a friend started a small consulting firm at 19 which I thought was pretty cool. After the business was acquired seven years later he began <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angel_investing">angel investing</a> and is now a partner at <a href="http://www.mobiusvc.com/">Mobius Venture Capital</a>. I found the discussion really interesting, and it was especially good to hear about his personal experiences as both an entreprenuer and a VC.I'm a massive rookie when it comes to this sort of thing but now I feel like I have a little bit more of an idea of how start-ups get off the ground. I definitely need to check out some of the other <a href="http://www.venturevoice.com/">Venture Voice</a> podcasts and see what else I can learn.</p>
