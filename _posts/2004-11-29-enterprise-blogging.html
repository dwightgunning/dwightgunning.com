<p>The topic of Enterprise Blogging has been on a mild simmer for for quite a while, every now and then boiling over with events such as those that <a href="http://blogs.salon.com/0000014/">Scott Rosenberg</a> describes in his entry titled <a href="http://blogs.salon.com/0000014/2004/11/22.html#a780"><em>Blogs can be hazardous to your paycheck</em></a>. Scott says of the uptake of enterprise blogging:</p>
<blockquote><p>Beyond the confines of an industry like software -- in which many of the individual workers are highly skilled, highly paid, mobile and relatively confident of their own re-employability -- it will happen a lot more slowly than the rhetoric at blogging conferences these days suggests.</p></blockquote>
<p>I totally agree with <a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2004/11/28/CorporateBlogging">Tim Bray's <em>Corporate Blogging</em> post</a> that internal blogs aren't representative of what global blogs will be like. I kept (past tense, I finished today :-D) an internal weblog for 10 months and I really felt restricted. Most of the buzz I get from blogging comes from the interaction and the sharing of ideas and thoughts with individuals that you have no relationship with aside from the topic of conversation. You just don't get that when you're publishing to a few colleagues. It's all about reading an awesome post, like <a href="http://jeremy.zawodny.com">Jeremy Zawodny</a>'s <a href="http://jeremy.zawodny.com/blog/archives/003079.html"><em>blogging as personal lubricant</em></a>, and acknowledging it both to the author and the rest of your own readership.</p>
