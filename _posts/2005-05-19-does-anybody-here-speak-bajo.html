<p>Nine Indonesian fisherman have been in custody for a couple months after allegedly fishing illegally in Australian waters.<br />
<blockquote>But in court today all charges against the fishermen were withdrawn because an interpreter could not be found in Australia that spoke a discrete sea gypsy dialect, called bajo.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/newsitems/200505/s1372463.htm">ABC News</a>For some reason I find the notion of fishermen speaking discrete gypsy sea dialects quite amusing.Also makes me think of a person in the office with a 'what shall we do with the drunken sailor' mobile ringtone.I dunno.</p>
