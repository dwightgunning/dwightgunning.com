<p>After spending a day and then a night in the bus, any normal person would probably have a quiet day catching up on sleep or maybe taking a stroll. I guess I'm probably not normal.After dropping my bags at a Belfast hostel at 8am, I walked straight into town and booked myself onto another bus tour. This time the destination was the Giant's Causeway which is about 125km away along the northern coastline. Taking a second coastal trip in consecutive days didn't lessen my enjoyment in the slightest. The views and those causeway stones are just too amazing.

<p style="text-align: left">That night I slept like a baby. Apparently the ear plugs worked so well that I missed out witnessing four drunken Irishmen keep the three other girls in the room awake the whole night. Next day I moved hostels and did some walking around with Judith, one of the sleep deprived, in a hunt for good coffee.</p>
<p style="text-align: left">Matt and Wes arrived mid-afternoon and we set ourselves up for Halloween with a meal at a Thai restaurant. This was by far the green curry I've ever had! The night involved a couple Guinness and a nip or two of Bushmill's at the Crown Liquor Salon before heading to a cool dress-up party at Thompsons niteclub.</p>
<p style="text-align: left">Next day we set about seeing the city centre and getting on a Black Cab tour to learn what <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_troubles">The troubles</a> were all about. Despite the driver carefully explaining everything, I still (and probably never will) really understand what all the fighting was for.</p>

<p style="text-align: left">That was pretty much all for Belfast. In the afternoon we caught a city bus out to Hillsborough to stay with some friends for a night. The following day we did the seaside town of Newcastle which was also worth a look.</p>
