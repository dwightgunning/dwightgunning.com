<p>Sam Gentile has some pretty interesting things to say in his post <a href="http://codebetter.com/blogs/sam.gentile/archive/2006/09/06/Being-an-Agile-Architect.aspx">Being an Agile Architect</a>.Lots of things are popping in and out of my head about this... too tired to write anything constructive or thought-provoking. Maybe another time.</p>
