<p>Myself and a couple friends have been using the <a href="http://del.icio.us">del.icio.us</a> <strong>for:</strong> tag pretty much since they released the feature.Jeremy Zawodny has just <a href="http://jeremy.zawodny.com/blog/archives/007318.html">blogged about it</a> and I was thinking about it the other day as well.While using the firefox plug-in I noticed that one of the for: tags was the biggest in my tag cloud and I was thinking it would be good if the tag would auto-time out after a week.The reason for this is that most of the things I tag 'for' others are temporal and I'm using the for tag as way of giving a quick shout out to friends who may be interested, without actually putting any other tags against the page. The for tag isn't really of interest to me so I'd rather it not take up so much space in my tag cloud.</p>
