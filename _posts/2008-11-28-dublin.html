<p>Since I'd had a pretty hectic week crisscrossing Ireland I really needed some time to chill out. Being as overcast and as expensive as it is, Dublin was a good place to be.That said, I still managed to take in a few of the sights during my stay. On the first day I took a walk from my hostel down to the Guinness Storehouse.The route I followed took me down O'Connell street past the modern Spire and the old General Post Office. Then it was across the Liffey river to Trinity College where I pretended to be a student for about half an hour. After this I went west behind the famous Temple Bar, and along Thompson Street where I found a pretty impressive old church.Walking is definitely the best way to to see a place. Here's some photographic evidence:
