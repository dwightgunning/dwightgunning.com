<p>Download <a href="http://sic.conversationsnetwork.org/shows/detail3142.html">this podcast</a>. It's an interesting talk given by William McDonough about ecologically intelligent design and the 'cradle to cradle' philosophy.The idea is to put an end to waste by by designing and producing things that are infinitely reusable/recyclable. He calls out businesses and governments for focussing on how they're doing less bad (e.g. reducing emissions by 15%), rather than saying what good things they've done well.The way this inverts the typical social perspective is really neat.If you like, I'd suggest you check out and subscribe to the <a href="http://www.conversationsnetwork.org/">Conversations Network</a>. After grabbing bits and pieces from them for the last few years, I've just started pulling down their podcasts pretty heavily for the past month or so. It's all good.</p>
