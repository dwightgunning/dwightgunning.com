<p><a href="http://blogs.salon.com/0000014/2005/01/10.html#a807">Scott Rosenberg</a> points to <a href="http://www.gotw.ca/publications/concurrency-ddj.htm">The Free Lunch Is Over: The fundamental trend toward concurrency in software</a>. It's an excellent article that looks at how CPU design trends (eg. hyperthreading &amp; multi-core processors) will force developers to get serious about concurrency at the application level if they're to create more and more complex software and have it execute at acceptable speeds.</p>
