* Enjoyed new years eve with friends. It was quiet but really nice.
* Recovered from some foot pain during a run at the beginning of the week - made it out for 8km on Sunday night
* Learned a bunch of sysadmin and DBA stuff for Knownly. Big infra improvements
* Pub Golf was hilarious fun
* Met up with a young Syrian refugee who's keen to improve his programming skills. Hopefully he learned a couple things and I can really help him out.
* FINISHED reading The Idiot after dragging it around with me for ~5 years!
