<p>As I think is the case for many people, I've always found travel exciting, inspirational and often an educational experience. Lately I've been considering the educational aspect more closely from an entrepreneurs perspective.</p>
<p>This thinking has evolved into the strong belief that travel is essential to aspiring and active entrepreneurs, regardless of whether travel, be it for sales or to meet investors, is inherently part of the venture.</p>
<p>When I travel, I always sense my understanding of the world is changing. Sometimes it's a cultural observation or a natural wonder that hits me like a tonne of bricks. Other times it's only subtle. But it's always there. This was the case when I travelled with my family as a young kid, and continues today whenever I travel for work or pleasure.</p>
<p>Getting away from your home town, region, or country virtually guarantees you'll experience new landscapes, interact with people of different race and ethnic background, or observe and be challenged to adapt to different cultures. Sometimes all at once. All these things nudge, or in some cases shake, our senses and in turn unlock creativity and allow new ideas to flow.</p>
<p>Most importantly, travel causes us to see aspects of our idea or business from a different perspective.</p>
<p>But let's be more concrete. Travel can show us new problems that are just waiting for innovative solutions. The different context and mindset that one naturally adopts when travelling should re-enforce or alter our personal vision, goals and objectives in ways that increase our commitment and determination to succeed. Being in a new place and around different people can point us to previously unrecognised markets for ideas or products we're working on. It can raise questions and concerns about the validity of our product or overall strategy under different conditions, which once answered or dealt with puts us in a stronger and better equipped position to move forward.</p>
<p>So why not call out out travel as a key educational aspect of the entrepreneurial journey. It's kind of orthogonal, but in addition to getting out of the building, I'm going to be reminding myself and advising other entrepreneurs to "get out of town".</p>
