<p>From a recent IBM developerWorks article, <a href="http://www-128.ibm.com/developerworks/opensource/library/os-junit/?ca=dgr-lnxw07JUnite">JUnit antipatterns</a>::<br />
<blockquote>A class or method should have a single responsibility. It should do one thing and do it well. The single responsibilities of the methods should support the single responsibility of their class. You can extend this principle to various levels of the system. For example, a component (an aggregation of tightly cohesive classes) should also have a single responsibility.As you shift layers, the individual responsibilities become increasingly abstract. A method may be responsible for splitting an e-mail address into a user name and a host name. A component may be responsible for authenticating a user.</p></blockquote>
<p>A good read for tdd newbies like me. I picked it up from the <a href="http://del.icio.us/rss/tag/tdd">del.icio.us tdd feed</a> ;-)</p>
