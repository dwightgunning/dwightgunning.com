<p>Sunday night saw myself and some friends head to the Coolangatta Hotel to see Melbourne band, <a href="http://www.dallascrane.com">The Dallas Crane</a>. It was a great gig, the locals in that part of the world are an interesting bunch and the smallish venue made for a fairly up-close and personal show. The two support acts, <a href="http://www.youngheartattack.net">Young Heart Attack</a> from Texas, and <a href="http://www.thed4band.com/">The D4</a> from New Zealand, rocked out to a smaller, but vocal crew earlier in the evening.To the bloke in the men's room who talked at me for over thirty seconds about how uncool I was for wearing earplugs as I stared at the wall ignoring him... <strong>Can you hear me now?</strong>Monday night after work I headed to the Brisbane Entertainment Center to see <a href="http://www.greenday.com/">Green Day</a>. Their support band, Simple Plan, were worse than boring, they were pathetic; I almost cried. And this was before the Canadian act leapt into an infuriating rendition of the "Aussie, Aussie, Aussie..." chant. I think a leaflet campaign at Australian airports would be appropriate in order to convey the message that you really need to be an Aussie to start-up and lead one of these nation-loving choruses. That's not to say I don't appreciate foreigners helping out with backing vocals to the "oi, oi, oi" section. In fact, I'm all for it! Anyway, the hords of school-aged kids running around seemed to get a kick out of it, so I guess some people were satisfied.Back to the point, Greenday were definitely on their game from the get go. Billy Joe was in fine form, whipping the crowd into a frenzy throughout the show opener, American Idiot. From there onwards, the Californians proceeded to play tracks from each of their albums along with a couple of covers. Their attempts to create a new rockband using members of the audience was almost a failure, although the second guitarist chosen carried himself pretty well on stage after the first choice proved to be useless. Trey Cool had to reclaim the skins after it was discovered the drummer they chose was incapable of maintaining beat. Eventually they managed to crank out a cover of Knowledge by <i>Operation Ivy</i> and I think everybody enjoyed the interlude to what was an otherwise frenetic gig. Those heading to the remaining shows definitely have a lot to look forward to.PSA: <a href="http://www.shockrecords.com/artists/info.asp?artist_ID=71484">The Mess Hall</a> play on the 15th April, at <a href="http://www.thezoo.com.au/">The Zoo</a> in Brisbane. I will be there, who else is coming?</p>
