<p>Cameron Reilly has <a href="http://reilly.typepad.com/cameronreilly/2005/04/aussie_politici.html">thrown his support</a> behind <a href="http://andrewbartlettonline.blogspot.com/">Andrew Bartlett</a> because he quotes Nick Cave, Tom Waits and Leonard Cohen.You gotta love a polly who gets <a href="http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2003/12/07/1070732073451.html?from=storyrhs&amp;oneclick=true">boozed up</a> and <a href="http://www.australianpolitics.com/news/2003/12/03-12-06a.shtml">harasses women</a> in parliament.So that was a cheap shot but the point stands that you can't judge a person by their taste in music. For the record, I listen to Cam's <a href="http://www.thepodcastnetwork.com">podcasts</a> and have subscribed to the Senator's newsfeed because I like the blurb:<br />
<blockquote>This web diary is an attempt to de-mystify politics and make the whole parliamentary process a bit more accessible and accountable. It also means I can get un-edited comments and feedback from people and get my views and arguments across without the media in the middle.</p></blockquote>
<p>...well said.</p>
