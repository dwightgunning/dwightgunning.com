<p>Over the last few months I realised two subtle yet serious flaws in the way I've been practicing the Getting Things Done method. The first is best described as efficiency without effectiveness. The second is excessive forward focus and too little time reflecting on achievements. They're easy traps to fall into so I want to describe each and point out some warning signs so that others can avoid them.</p>
<p><strong>Efficiency without effectiveness</strong><br />
Efficiency is the ability to get things done with the optimal investment of time and other resources. It's important but on it's own it is not enough. Efficiency says nothing about whether what you're doing is actually of relevance and value. This is where effectiveness comes into consideration. You want to be putting energy towards tasks and goals that you actually value.</p>
<p>Warning signs for efficiency without effectiveness is a task list with too many trivialities, too many mundane chores (renewing a drivers license, completing tax returns etc.). If I don't see tasks that tie up to a major goal or form part of my vision for life then I know there is cause for concern. If I don't have clear goals recently written down then that's definitely a red light.</p>
<p><strong>Forward focus without time for reflection</strong><br />
Always looking forward and not taking time to reflect can lead to stress because there are always so many options and opportunities out there. Taking the time to reflect on achievements, failures and lessons learned allows me to extract greater enjoyment, identify things that needÂ  improvement, and correct/adjust my course.</p>
<p>If I am not spending at least a few minutes each day to consider what I achieved and enjoyed doing, I know I am heading for trouble. Ideally I want to be able to immediately recall a recent highlight or success because I've already consciously reflected on it and "banked" the positives. The red light here is not knowing whether I spent my day on the things most important to me.</p>
<p><strong>Outcomes</strong><br />
Identifying and correcting these two areas has helped me reach a greater degree of focus, confidence and overall satisfaction with life and what I'm working on. Building the concepts and solutions into my regular habits (such as my Daily Top 3) and Weekly Review has even led to other significant improvements. I'm pretty sure it can do the same for you.</p>
