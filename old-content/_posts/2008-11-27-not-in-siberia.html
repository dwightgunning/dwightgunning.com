<p>It's unfortunate but my plans for the trans-Siberian trip didn't eventuate. To be honest, after traveling for so long I'm not sure how I would handle a week inside a train. Perhaps it's for the best.Hopefully at some point in the future I can plan a trip that will let me spend more time in Mongolia, visit towns around lake Baikal, and enjoy some of the cities like Novosibirsk along the way.The upshot is that I get an extra few days to explore Moscow which has proved to be quite interesting so far.On Sunday I'll be flying to Helsinki for a night. Then on Monday night I'll board a flight to Beijing and arrive Tuesday morning. I will pick up the plan for Asia from there.</p>
