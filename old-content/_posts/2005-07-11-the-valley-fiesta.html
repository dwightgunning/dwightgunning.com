<p>I had a sensational time at the <a href="http://www.ourbrisbane.com/whatson/valleyfiesta/">Valley Fiesta</a>. The bands that I saw were all great and the organisation of the whole event was well done. Well Done!I kicked it off last Wednesday night with the <a href="http://www.hotsnakes.com">Hot Snakes</a>. They were the sauce, just as I had predicted. A mate and I were toying with the idea of trekking to Sydney for their Saturday night gig at the Annandale, but I couldn't afford it. Which sucks because, according to <a href="http://comicbooksandcandy.blogspot.com/2005/07/fisticuffs-at-hot-snakes.html">yellowbird</a>, it sounds like it was every bit as good as the brisbane show:<br />
<blockquote>They played pretty much all of their new stuff with some old songs sprinkled through. The whole set was tight, and the sound levels were pretty spot on, meaning you could hear every delicious part of their music.</p></blockquote>
<p>Over the course of the weekend I saw a couple other bands including <a href="http://www.davidmccormack.com.au">Dave McCormack and the Polaroids</a> and <a href="http://www.youami.net/spit_polish.htm">Tim Rogers and the Temperance Union</a>... both these guys are top notch entertainers and their free shows were a highlight. DMC cracks me up every time.And while I'm on music, I cannot stress enough how much you need to go out and buy the new album from <a href="http://www.themesshall.com.au">The Mess Hall</a>. It's titled <em>notes from a ceiling</em> and I dig it the most.
