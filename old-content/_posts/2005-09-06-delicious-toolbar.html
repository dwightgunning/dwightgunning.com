<p>This is just a quick follow up to my introduction to the del.icio.us firefox plug-in.According to <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/?p=205">TechCrunch</a>, it's rumoured that del.icio.us may release a new toolbar.The post also links to another plug-in for del.icio.us called <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/extensions/moreinfo.php?application=firefox&amp;category=Newest&amp;numpg=10&amp;id=1153">Very Delicious</a> that I might try out and post some comments up here.</p>
