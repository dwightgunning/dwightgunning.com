<p>I think reading blogs has started to make me a little uncomfortable with what I'm doing with my life. Some of them anyway. It's just that there's so much cool stuff happening out there that people blog about and I can't help feeling kind of envious. Everyday I I read about how some blogger who's attending a cool conference, meeting interesting people, publishing a great idea or voicing an opinion that I can totally relate to. I wanna be doing engaging, groundbreaking, meaningful stuff too, damnit!Then again, I suppose I should put more of a positive spin on it. I should think more about how great it is that I get to see whats happening out there instead of just living in my own little world with the blinkers on. And the grass is always greener on the other side, right? People write about the interesting stuff and leave out the boring details.I guess I just need to be more patient.</p>
