<p>Galway is a smallish city on the west coast of Ireland, close to the Cliffs of Mohare. Back when we were in Budapest we met a couple of Americans students in Budapest who study there. So it was a logical place to visit.Since Matt and Wes were still in Dublin, I booked into a local hostel for the Sunday night and figured I'd make some new friends. The hostel was nice and clean but it was too sterile and nobody seemed to interested in meeting/socialising with other guests. So I went out to dinner solo and started chatting with a couple of guys who were at the table next to me. We ended up moving onto another club with some live music so it turned out to be a great night (read: more "craic").I rejoined forces with Matt and Wes the next afternoon and the three of us made the most of the pubs and scenery in downtown Galway. There's a few interesting little winding, pedestrian only streets that you can cruise around. Plus an extremely fast flowing river.

<p>The following day we took a bus tour out to the Cliffs of Mohare. There were quite a few interesting stops along the tour; beautiful coastlines and rolling countryside. The highlight was obviously the cliffs and I'd definitely put the trip down as a 'must do' in Ireland.

<p>After the tour, I figured that I'd seen just about everything that Galway has to offer and decided to leave. So I started plotting a course for Belfast at around 10pm and was in a Belfast bus terminal by 7:00 next morning.</p>
