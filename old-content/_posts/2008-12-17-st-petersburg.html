<p style="text-align: left">St. Petersburg is another city that I had wished I could have visited in 2006. Since I'd read Crime and Punishment that year I was excited by the idea of strolling up Nevsky Prospect, crossing the Neva to Vasilievsky Island, and seeing the  Dostoevsky museum that's set up in one of his old flats.</p>
<p style="text-align: left">With the mandatory "tourist invitation" and visa in place, I managed to do all that on this trip. What was amazing was that there's so much more to see and do which I didn't really figure out until doing some proper research.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a title="Palace Bridge by dwightgunning, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/dwightgunning/3057232098/"><img class="alignnone" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3241/3057232098_1549fc8f6a_m.jpg" alt="Palace Bridge" width="240" height="180" /></a></p>

<p style="text-align: left">I will never profess to understand or be a lover of art. Regardless, The Hermitage was an amazing experience. I was quite taken by the quality of the exhibits and the breath of the collection. Being situated in the Winter Palace, even the exterior is photograph worthy.</p>

<p style="text-align: left">St Isaac's Cathedral was another great find which actually came about by chance. I was struggling to see or find anything with so much snow falling around the Armoury. Then a Hungarian bloke asked if I would mind taking his photo in front of the large, but otherwise innocuous, Church that I'd just spent a few minutes staring at.</p>

<p style="text-align: left">All in all, St. Petersburg was not an easy place to visit. It's damn expensive too. But on whole it was well worth the effort.</p>
