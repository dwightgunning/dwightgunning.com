<blockquote>It's a big pain in my arse when I update something on my laptop, and then have to remember to replicate it on my PC at home. Big pain. I think the time is right to stuff a micro Web server into the browser to make all this data available via http URLs, so that I can point another copy of Firefox at it and have my experience cloned. Ok, maybe not the cache or history, but you get the point.</p></blockquote>
