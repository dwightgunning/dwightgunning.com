<p>I spent the last couple of days of my trip in Tokyo and no self respecting tech junky would miss the chance to visit the monument to hi-tech consumerism that is <a href="http://www.akiba.or.jp/index_e.html">Akihabara</a>. On <a href="http://www.jreast.co.jp/e/">JR</a>'s <a href="http://www.japan-guide.com/e/e2370.html">Yamanote Line</a>, it is chock full of multi-level stores selling PC gear, consumer electronics, white goods and all manner of appliances.On the shopping list were a digital camera, a decent capacity memory card for the camera, and some sort of portable music device. At one of the stores I had a close look at the iRiver iFP-900 which I <a href="http://stuntshow.blogspot.com/2004/12/portable-audio.html">shortlisted</a> prior to leaving Australia, but I ruled out purchasing it due to (a) dwindling funds, (b) the lack of an international warantee (according the staff member I spoke to), and (c) an uninspiring display. Without purchasing the iRiver, I had a little more cash to play with on the digital camera front. After conversing with the staff in a messy combination of English and Japanese, I established that the <a href="http://www.pentaximaging.com/index.jsp">Pentax Optio S5i</a> (review <a href="http://www.dpreview.com/reviews/pentaxs5i/">here</a> at <a href="http://www.dpreview.com">Digital Photography Review</a>) had the right warantee and offered the best bang for buck.It's a cinch to use, has a pretty dependable point-and-shoot mode, and seems to have plenty of options for me to play with. The picture quality is definitely fine for the amaturish photography that I'll be engaging in. I'll put some samples up as soon as I figure out how to load and resize the images in <a href="http://www.gimp.org">GIMP</a>.</p>
