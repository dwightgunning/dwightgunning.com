<p>Me neither.But then I recieved an email about an employee share program I'm involved in which provided me with a PURL.<br />
<blockquote>To access your online account, we have provided you with a secure, easy to use Personal URL address (PURL)</p></blockquote>
<p>But don't worry, it's just a standard URL that points to a resource that's specific to me.I did some more hunting around and I was interested to see that <a href="http://www.acronymfinder.com/af-query.asp?String=exact&amp;Acronym=PURL&amp;Find=Find">Acronym Finder</a> list a PURL as a <i>Persistent</i> URL.When I read that I sorta said 'Yaaa' - like <i>Yet Another Ambiguous Acronym</i>.</p>
