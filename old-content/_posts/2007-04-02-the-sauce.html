<p>I've been browsing around the <a href="http://www.djangoproject.com">Django</a> site for a few weeks and just discovered the <a href="http://code.djangoproject.com/wiki/DjangoResources">django resources</a> page. It's a collection of heaps of really really good links to <em>unofficial</em> stuff out on the web.It's kinda hidden so this is just a little pointer.</p>
