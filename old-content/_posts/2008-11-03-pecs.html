<p>PÃ©cs is another smaller town in Hungary. While Eger is in the north-east, PÃ©cs sits in the south-west and is a little further away.I managed to see it in a day, although I'd probably recommend staying a night and using it as a stopover along your way out of Hungary and into Slovenia, Serbia or Romania.The drawcards for PÃ©cs is the awkwardly named Mosque Church and the museums. The museums house artifacts that illustrate the Turkish occupation and influence within the town (e.g. said Church with many features that are typically found in a mosque).I really liked PÃ©cs for the marble, sandstone, and brighter coloured buildings which give it a real mediteranian feel.<a title="Szechenyi Square in Pecs by dwightgunning, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/dwightgunning/2981425040/"></a>
