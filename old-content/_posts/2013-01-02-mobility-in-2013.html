<p>I spent the last few days in Berlin and was reminded just how much of a buzz I get in the subway from the masses of people moving about. Both at the stations and in the carriages I find myself curious about where the people around me might be heading to. I wonder if they're just making their way from A to B on a regular commute, or whether they're on some sort of important and maybe even life-changing journey.</p>
<p>The way so many people are empowered to move around in the 21st century, be it across town or across the globe, is really an amazing thing. What also really excites me is the innovation in consumer technology that makes the underlying transportation services easier and more convenient. In recent years my favorites have been <a title="Trip It" href="http://www.tripit.com" target="_blank">Trip It</a>, <a title="Kayak" href="http://www.kayak.com" target="_blank">Kayak</a>, <a title="Seat Guru" href="http://www.seatguru.com/" target="_blank">SeatGuru</a>, <a title="Waze" href="http://www.waze.com/" target="_blank">Waze</a>, <a title="Car2Go" href="https://www.car2go.com" target="_blank">Car2Go</a> and numerous ride-sharing and public transport timetable/route-planners. This short list hardly scratches the surface and with so many people out there moving around, there's endless opportunities to innovate.</p>
<p>More proof that mobility and transport is a dynamic and exciting space are the acquisition talks between <a title="Is Apple Plotting A Route To A Waze Acquisition?" href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/01/02/is-apple-plotting-a-route-to-a-waze-acquisition-rumours-on-the-road-point-to-yes/" target="_blank">Apple and Waze</a>, and also between <a title="Avis to buy Zipcar for $500MM" href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/01/02/avis-to-buy-zipcar-for-500-million/" target="_blank">Avis and ZipCar</a>. In both cases and assuming the deals go ahead, it'll be interesting to see how these great services continue to operate under new ownership.</p>
<p>Recently I've been working on <a title="Revirda" href="https://revirda.com" target="_blank">Revirda</a> which helps taxi drivers to be more effective and provide great service to their passengers. We're solving a real problem for the drivers and at the same time improving the overall system for the public. I'm looking forward to making 2013 a big year.</p>
