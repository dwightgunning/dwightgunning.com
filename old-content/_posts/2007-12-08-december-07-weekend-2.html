<p>As expected December is running away on me quicker than I can describe.No downtime midweek since I saw movies on Mon/Tues, played the regular Wed night poker tournament with mates and the n the weekly basketball game in Brisbane on Thursday.Last night I checked out this tiny local pub/bar that goes by the name of the 'The Back Page'. I haven't been there in a couple years and was pleased to see it's still going strong off the back of the Friday afternoon tradesman crew. Perfect for a quite brew to toast the start of another fine weekend. The lack of pokies, pubTAB, keno etc. is a refreshing change and reminder not all pub owners are like the money grabbing purveyors of sin in Surfers Paradise and Broadbeach.No plans are set in stone for the weekend except a 5:05pm flight to Canberra on Sunday night. So there's nothing else to do but check out the beach. One could be stuck with worse things to do...</p>
