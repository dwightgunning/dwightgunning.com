<p>Following up on <a href="http://stuntshow.blogspot.com/2005/03/sonys-new-flash-based-mp3-players.html">a previous post</a> that started out on portable audio and ended up at technology convergence, here's an interesting post about <a href="http://www.russellbeattie.com/notebook/1008358.html">mobile gadget form factors</a> from mobility guru and my favourite blogger, <a href="http://www.russellbeattie.com/notebook">Russell Beattie</a>.This is kind of connected to some thinking I've been doing about how bad it is trying to read long articles on a PC screen. In particular, what I would want in a Tablet PC. I was thinking a little outside the box and decided that a foldable LCD display would be too cool. I'd take the standard clam-shell laptop and make both halves a single LCD, with a nice fold in the middle. Instead of a physical keyboard and touchpad, I'd type directly onto a software based keypad on the lower 1/2 of the display. I don't like the touchpad, so I'd hide that (its software remember :-)and put the system clock and tray down there. Cool. Then, when I'm reading a long article I could go to full screen mode and have at least an A4 sized screen of text to look at.This would work for mobile gadgets too. Depending on what facet of the converged device the user wants to use, a particular display/interface configuration could be displayed. There's more than one way to skin a a cat so why aren't designers thinking about customisable input mechanisms for these devices?</p>
