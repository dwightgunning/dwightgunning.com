<p>The latest column in the <a href="http://www.xml.com/pub/at/34">The Restful Web  series</a>, titled 'Constructing or Traversing URIs' looks at a neat way to expose a ReSTful service without locking in the URI structure.Reading each of Joe's articles in this column seriously reminds me of the steps I (never, could of, should of... etc) went through last year in developing a prototype web service during my internship at SAP. I've blogged it <a href="http://stuntshow.blogspot.com/2004/12/howto-restful-protocol.html">before</a>, but the first article really distills so many of the things I took weeks to nut out, making them seem really straight forward. I looked high and low on the web, trying to find the solutions he presents in such a straight-forward manner. I suppose things are more concrete and believeable when they're published by a pro but I was always second guessing myself about whether a certain approach was the right way to go.This latest article really hits on what would have been a nice logical step forward for my service. I eventually came up with a reasonable URI space and had the service doing mostly what it should do, but it was time to finish up and graduate. So although the point of the service was really to expose other resources as the client drilled deeper in through the content, it would have been nice to have implemented a more formal definition.Anyway, the consultant life that I now lead leaves me with a just a little bit of time to cut some code and try things out. I'm having another crack at an Eclipse RCP application to sort (and eventually tag) digital images off my camera. Folksonomies are the flavour of the month afterall. Hopefully I'll get the Eclipse thing right this time.</p>
