<p><a href="http://scoble.weblogs.com/">Scoble</a>'s post <a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/2004/12/23.html#a8992">Are there enough women in your blogroll</a> made me think about the number of blogs I read which are authored by females. Of the 25 mainly tech blogs I read, <A href="http://napsterization.org/stories/">Mary Hodder's <i>Napsterization</i></a> is the only one thats written by a female. And that's assuming Mary is female... no joke/offense -- aside from inferring the gender of the author based on their first name, how am I to know for sure.And thats probably a pretty good point to make. Even though weblogs offer transperancy and an insight into the mind of the author, the only guidance about the gender of the author is whats given away in the entries that they make public.The beauty of the blogosphere is the way good authors present themselves to you. I think I started out back in February following <a href="http://www.intertwingly.net/blog/">Sam Ruby</a>, <a href="">Tim Bray</a> &amp; <a href="http://bitworking.org/">Joe Gregorio</a>. This soon grew as I picked up references from these three blogs that pointed to other weblogs that had something interesting to say. I'm not at all concerned that I'm not reading ~50% female weblogs, its not like politics (and other instances) where an even gender split is important. I'm reading mostly male authors because I appreciate what they write. As more female authors who write things that matter to me come across my screen, they'll go on my blogroll.</p>
