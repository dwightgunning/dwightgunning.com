<p>I just had some really flakey connectivity last week which was totally foreign to me. Normally if I have no access to the net I can adjust and not think about it. But for the majority of last week I had a really weak wireless connection that kept dropping out every few minutes. Totally frustrating.The connectivity issues were a side effect of joining a new project and having to jump through the necessary hoops to gain access to the right systems etc. Add to the mix the standard background reading requirement and you get the idea that I've been plenty occupied at work.We had internet put on at the rental place where I'm currently staying (the use of 'living' here would not be truly representative) but the environment isn't really condusive to creative thinking.Anyway I'm battling through that and on the weekend I got started with <a href="">Python</a>. It's a slight departure from the o-o lifestyle I've led for the last 7 years so I'm looking forward to hooking right into it though. So far I have the <a href="http://pydev.sourceforge.net/">PyDev</a> plugin for Eclipse running reasonably smoothly thanks to <a href="http://www-128.ibm.com/developerworks/opensource/library/os-ecant/">this article</a>.Despite the <a href="http://www.kottke.org/05/08/so-long-technorati">flak</a> that technorati is getting at the moment, I want to see if I can hook into its public API via python. I have a little idea for a bit of a composite web service which could be cool. Although, the AJAX front end I'm thinking through is probably a little beyond my reach but I'll see how far I can run with it.Also noteworthy was last nights setup of <a href="http://www.ubuntulinux.org/">ubuntu</a>. I put it on a virtual machine on my laptop and the install process went kind of smoothly. I think something may have broken so I ctrl-c'd a few things here and there that looked to have stalled, I'll have to see what happens when I configure it. My mate Paul <a href="http://smithslog.blogspot.com/2005/08/ubuntu.html">had the ISOs</a> and I'd already heard good things from the likes of <a href="http://www.intertwingly.net/blog/2005/05/04/Ubuntu-Update">Sam Ruby</a>. The impetus for this was to try out a new distro in a tidy little sandbox, and have a linux instance handy while both my general workstation and file server, both <a href="http://www.slackware.org">slackware</a>, are in storage.Hopefully I'll publish some updates later in the week.</p>
