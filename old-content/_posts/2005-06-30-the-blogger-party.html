<blockquote>I think it's time we set up a new party. A party for the 21st century. The pro-technology, pro-transparency, pro-euthanasia, pro-republic party. A party that isn't in the pockets of corporate interests, the unions, or right-wing Christians. A party for the 18 - 40 demographic.The Blogger Party.</p></blockquote>
<p>I don't think The Blogger Party should necessarily be any of the above, except for transparent. The Blogger Party will listen to the people and encourage community involvement to make true democratic decisions. The wider community have differing prorities and probably aren't that interested in technology. And it's probably line ball on euthanasia and becoming a republic. The Blogger Party will be open and free. The Blogger Party won't seek to appeal to any particular demographic.And so on...</p>
