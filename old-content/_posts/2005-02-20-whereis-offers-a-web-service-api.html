<p>Looking up directions to a friends house yesterday, I saw that <a href="http://www.whereis.com.au">WhereIs</a> offers a web service interface for accessing its street directory service. Cool. I emailed an account request through but haven't recieved any details as yet. There's a brief overview <a href="http://www.whereis.com.au:80/whereis/products/prod_nav_api.jsp">here</a>. I'll post more details here when I get to play around with it.Also, <a href="http://stephenwithers.com">Stephen Wither</a> has created an Outlook plugin that makes use of the service. I haven't tried it, but you can grab it from <a href="http://www.versiontracker.com/dyn/moreinfo/win/35451">here</a>.</p>
