<p>There's <a href="http://www.technorati.com/search/Pandora+music">plenty of buzz</a> around for the new music service, <a href="http://www.pandora.com/">Pandora</a>.Basically it's your own custom web-radio station. You start by seeding it with a band or track you like, then it automatically chooses the subsequent tunes that play from bands that offer a similar style. During each track you have the opportunity to give the thumbs up or down and move on. Or you can just let it play right through.My tastes vary from quite punky stuff to more mild pop-rock so it's useful that I can setup multiple 'stations' that play to my differing moods.I tried to start with a couple of Aussie bands (<a href="http://www.somethingforkate.com">Something for Kate</a> and <a href="http://www.powderfinger.com">Powderfinger</a>) and it didn't recognise them. No doubt as the user base expands the service will grow to include more worldly music selection.I definitely agree with <a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/2005/08/28.html#a10979">Scoble's post</a> suggesting a rich client front end would be good. At times the "everything has to be a Web app" argument annoys me too.</p>
