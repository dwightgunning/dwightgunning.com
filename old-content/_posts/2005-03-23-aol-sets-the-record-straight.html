<p>Last week <a href="http://stuntshow.blogspot.com/2005/03/now-i-know-why-i-dont-use-aim.html">I linked</a> to a post over at BoingBoing about an interesting clause in AOL's terms of service for their AIM product. AOL have come to the party and fixed things up and as you can see, BoingBoing have <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2005/03/15/aol_fixes_its_terms_.html">commended</a> AOL for revising the license. It's nice to see big organisations like AOL listening to the public and acting quickly to do the right thing. Highly Commended.</p>
