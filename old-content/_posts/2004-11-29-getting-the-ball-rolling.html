<p>I was hoping that things would be flowing a little bit better than this. After at least week since I published my first entry the best I've done is draft a couple of posts and then figured them not worth publishing. In an effort to keep the ball rolling I'll talk about some of the good news...I've finished my undergraduate degree, a batchelor of Information Technology (<em>Software Engineering</em>).</p>
<p>I had my last exam a few weeks ago, submitted a project, and have the last day of a 10 month internship tomorrow. When I started in February I had no clue how things really happen in the IT industry. The internship at <a href="http://www.sap.com/research">SAP Research</a> has been totally amazing. I've learnt so much (most importantly, the in-s and out-s of weblogging) it shocks me. I've worked on some semantic web / enterprise services projects and had the chance to use REST and RDF and basically get a real buzz from being closer to the The Edge of heaps of new technologies. I'm really hoping that what I've learnt and my ideas in these areas will start to show up on this blog.</p>
<p>The reason I'm 'hoping', is because next year I'm going to be doing something completely different. I've taken a grad. position with <a href="http://www.accenture.com.au">Accenture</a> and there's no way I'll be so immersed in these exciting new technologies in my day to day work. If I stick with it for long enough, I'll probably get some of that buzz again in a few years when the <em>rest of the world</em> catches up. Hopefully I'll keep mucking around with RDF/OWL stuff and get involved in some OSS project or something... who knows.</p>
