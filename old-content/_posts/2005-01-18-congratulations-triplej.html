<p>Tomorrow marks thirty years of <a href="http://www.triplej.net.au">TripleJ</a> broadcasting.The station started in 1975 and was initially known as Double J. Back then, on an AM frequency only available to Sydney, the then-banned "You only love me 'cause I'm good in bed" by The Sky Hooks, was the first track they broadcast. In 1980 they renamed themselves Triple J as they moved to FM and between 1989 and 1996 they broadened their coverage to 95% of the Australian population. Interestingly, they say that some communities even fund-raised and built their own transmitters just to be a part of the action. <a href="http://abc.net.au/triplej/about/about.htm">More History Here</a>.One of the things I appreciate most about the station is that its funded by the government and hence has no advertisements or commercials. In a replay of a live gig that <a href="http://www.dischord.com/bands/fugazi.shtml">fugazi</a> performed in 1991, vocalist Ian MacKaye congratulates the station on its recent move to broadcast nationally and thanks the Australian tax-payer for funding the "experiment in music." Thats a pretty big plug when you consider Fugazi's attitude towards commercialism and the music industry.</p>
