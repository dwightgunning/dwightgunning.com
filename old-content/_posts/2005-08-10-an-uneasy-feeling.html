<p>Just days after the 60th anniversary of the the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, I feel more than a little uneasy when I read about Uranium trading.Yesterday there was <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/newsitems/200508/s1433324.htm">a report</a> that Australia is holding discussions with China to decide on a 'nuclear cooperation agreement'. Alexander Downer assures us that the agreement will make certain any traded Uranium is used for peaceful purposes.It's that same uneasy feeling I had when I visited the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiroshima_Peace_Park">Hiroshima Peace Memorial</a>; that too many innocent lives were lost and that so long as countries are producing enriched <sup>235</sup>U, it could happen again. Hopefully it doesn't.</p>
