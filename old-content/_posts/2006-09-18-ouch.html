<p>I hope this Home Shopping Network presenter is okay. He's managed to snap and somehow <a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=5243836417224631021">stab himself</a> with one of those dodgy samurai swords they sell on teevee. Ouch! There's no gore so enjoy at home or on your lunchbreak :-)Great ad-lib by the co-presenter too. Champagne television.</p>
