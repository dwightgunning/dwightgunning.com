<p>Not <a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2005/07/14/Drupal-Server">long ago</a>, Tim Bray put the wheels in motion @ Sun to donate some hardware to <a href="http://www.drupal.org">Drupal</a>. They had some serious server issues and needed a hand.Now it turns out Drupal are using the cash donations they also recieved to go out and purchase Dell boxes. Tim has just <a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2005/07/20/OSS-Ecosystem">pointed out</a> that Dell aren't really big investors in Open Source.Obviously its up to Drupal to decide how they spend the cash but I think Tim has a point.I'm watching for <a href="http://www.technorati.com/search/www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2005/07/20/OSS-Ecosystem">Technorati in-links</a> and <a href="http://bloglines.com/citations?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.tbray.org%2Fongoing%2FWhen%2F200x%2F2005%2F07%2F20%2FOSS-Ecosystem&amp;submit=Search">Bloglines citations</a>.[Update]Here's <a href="http://staff.osuosl.org/~kveton/2005/07/20/on-the-drupal-donations/">more</a> on the decision to go with Dell, from the horses mouth.</p>
