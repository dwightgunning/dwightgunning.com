<p style="text-align: left">My stay in Moscow was extended since I didn't take the trans-Siberian railway.</p>
<p style="text-align: left">I've decided this was a good thing because the Capital, and Russia as a whole, is such a unique place. I'll admit it's probably the most difficult place to be in that I've ever visited. I guess that's all part of the charm.</p>
<p style="text-align: left">Through the first few days I managed to see Gorky Park, Red Square, Lenin's Mausoleum and of course the Kremlin.</p>

<p style="text-align: left">After burning out on tourist attractions I arranged to meet up with a few Couch Surfers for coffees, lunches and trips to less touristy destinations. Still later in my stay I spent a day inside the flat, tried vodka for breakfast, and ate plain rice because I deemed it too expensive to eat out.</p>
<p style="text-align: left">Moscow really was all that I expected. It's cold, wet-snowy-wet at this time of year, and generally pretty depressing. But that's just the on the surface. The people I managed to have genuine conversations with were all wonderful people with bright and interesting stories to tell.</p>
<p style="text-align: left">As it stands with visa requirements, I won't be rushing back. On the other hand, if these things change or if I get the opportunity to go out on business, I'll definitely jump at the chance to visit Moscow again.</p>
