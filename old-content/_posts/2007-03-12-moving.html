<p>I'm in the process of moving this well and truly neglected blog over to a new server and some new, yet to be decided, blogging software.The rationale is that having my own hosting motivate me to post more often. It'll also give me an outlet to let loose the various bits and pieces of prototype and sample apps I've created over the years. I keep telling people I'm a web developer  but it seems rather fake without my own website. It should be some fun too.No doubt the minuscule readership I once enjoyed will have either removed me from their aggregators or forgotten the url entirely. Hopefully some more frequent posting about interesting stuff can bring a few people back and entice a few newcomers.Time will tell.</p>
