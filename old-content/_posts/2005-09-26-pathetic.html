<p>Sorry to leave you guys hanging for the last two weeks with no posts. Not blogging for 17 days is pretty pathetic.Anyway I'm back in Brisbane after an excellent trip. The training will prove useful in time and the co-curricular activities were outstanding.I need to get up to speed with whats going on in Techland. What have I missed?</p>
