<p>I leave for Japan next week. Asia is <i>the place</i> to buy all the newest and coolest consumer electronics, so I figure I'd be mad not to pick up something funky in the way of portable audio when I'm there.Before I get into it, the <a href="http://www.apple.com/ipod/">iPod</a> is out of the question. Bleep - Gone.Some criteria:
<li>At least 3 hours of high quality music -- I'll be on the train for about this long each day. I don't need crazy amounts of storage because I'm not all that interested in storing my entire music collection on one of these devices. I have a CD rack &amp; I use it.</li>
<li>Flash Based -- I'm pretty rough on my toys &amp; since I don't need 60GB of storage I can score the size/weight advantages of flash.</li>
<li>Removable Battery --- Rechargable batterys life expectancy is a whole lot lower than that of your average homosapien. I may not be average but I don't want hassles with the battery. If its got a removable battery (even a funky proprietary one is better than nothing), then I can just replace it if things go bad.</li>
<li>Radio Tuner --- This would be a huge plus. I love <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/triplej">TripleJ</a> and wished all year that I could listen to the brekky show while I was on the way to work.</li>
<p>So far I'm looking at the <a href="http://www.iriveramerica.com/products/iFP-999.aspx">iRiver iFP-999</a>. It's cool because it supports the <a href="http://www.vorbis.com/">Ogg Vorbis</a> format, a Very Good Thing. It also does FM radio and has a built in recorder so you can dictate any time. Apparently you can set it up to programmatically record from a preset radio channel at a given time... No more missing out on the Monday night <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/triplej/live/latw.htm">Live At The Wireless</a> set. It's also got a handy 1GB storage capacity and what looks to be a fairly tidy design. I've never seen/used iRiver's products before so I'm a little bit edgy about trying out a new company. Another downside to the '999 is that it's got an internal battery.</p>
<p>An alternative is the <a href=""> Creative Muvo TX FM</a>. It's got the 1GB capacity thing happening and it takes a AAA battery which is definitely a point for the Muvo. FM radio and graphic equalizer. Unfortunately, I've had unpleasant experiences with Creative soundcards in the past so while I've never heard of iRiver, I'm not exactly confident in the Creative brand name either.</p>
<p>Overall I think the Muvo takes the style points just by looking at the photo's but the features of the '999 blow it away. I'll probably go hunt down the '999 and if there's no show stoppers when I get it in my hand I'll lay down the cash.I'll Keep you posted.</p>
