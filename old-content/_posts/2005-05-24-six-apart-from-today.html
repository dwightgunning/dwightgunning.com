<p>Yesterday marked six months of blogging in the wild through Stunt Show. Yay me! I think I can make another six months and then hopefully a many more after that. But have I improved? Can I do better? I'd sure like more readers.<a href="http://www.sixapart.com">SixApart</a> get a mention because their product MovableType was the first blogging software I tried, all the way back in ~February last year.</p>
