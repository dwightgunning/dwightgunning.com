<p>Where?Zdair. It's a small village on the Slovakian side of the <a title="Tatra Mountains" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tatra_Mountains">Tatra Mountains</a>, not far south from the border with Poland. It was great to get away from the bigger cities and do some hiking and mountain biking in the fresh air.

<p>This beautiful spot wasn't on the original itinerary so I'm really thankful we got some good advice and so glad we made the effort to get down there.I liked the idea of the Tatras and was reading up on towns further south like Stary Smokovec and Tatranska Lomnica in the Lonely Planet. It was just lucky that another Aussie bloke I met in Krakow had just come from Zdair and recommended we stay at The Ginger Monkey. I now recommend it to you.</p>
