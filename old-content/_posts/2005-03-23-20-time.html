<p>Apparently, if you work at google you are allowed to spend 20% of you're time working on whatever you want. So says <a href="http://ponderer.org/twenty_percent">Tony Chang</a>. Cool! Initially I thought he meant you can tool around doing <i>whatever the hell you want</i>, but then I realised the aim is to be productive and contribute in an area that interests you. Still pretty cool.<a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/2005/03/19.html#a9686">Scoble</a> says that if Bill G. told him to do whatever he wants for 20% of the time, he'd just keep doing the same thing. Lucky guy. I reckon I'm doing things I enjoy for about 70% of the time. So if I could what I want for 20%, then it'd only be 10% of the time that I'm not liking what I'm doing. I could live with that.I'll tell you what, I'm super jealous of everybody in The States having conferences to attend every 5 minutes. It would be so cool to go meetin' and greetin' all the "ideas people" that hangout at those things. Every week I'm reading about how the vibe is back in the Valley.There isn't much of a vibe in Queensland, although at least the beaches are nice.</p>
