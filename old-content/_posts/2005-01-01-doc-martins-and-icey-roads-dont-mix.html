<p>Since I still don't own a second pair of shoes, the Doc Martin's are getting a pretty decent work out over here in the snow. They're like sleds on the icey road; all fun and games 'til somebody breaks a tail bone. Its pretty nasty but I'm getting by.Spent another few hours on the slopes today despite a wicked hangover after last nights festivities. It was a great night, everybody had a load of fun. Too many stories to tell.I'm cruising off for a late night <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Onsen">onsen</a>.</p>
