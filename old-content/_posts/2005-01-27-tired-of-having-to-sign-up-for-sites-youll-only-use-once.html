<p>I just stumbled across <a href="http://www.bugmenot.com">BugMeNot</a>. It keeps a database of generic log-in accounts for heaps of websites that require users to sign up. You just enter the URL of the site you want to access.It's probably not the most ethically correct site around. I personally would shy away from it for accessing cost-walled news sites like the <a href="http://www.afr.com">Australian Financial Review</a>, but for free sites that just collect your details in order to on-sell them to some unscrupulous online marketing company... I'll sleep easy at night.</p>
