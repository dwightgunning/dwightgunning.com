<div>I just installed and ran the demo that comes with the <a href="http://celtix.objectweb.org/index.html">Celtix</a> ESB I mentioned last week. So far so good - I haven't done anything to serious yet.What I did find interesting is that it's built on <a href="http://www.springframework.org">Spring</a> which means you configure the bus using an XMLBeanFactory. As the guide says, that's about all you need to know about Spring however it probably gives me a little bit more encouragement to download the source and see what's happening under the hood.</div>
