<p>Rory is talking about <a href="http://neovolve.com/archive/2007/03/28/shane-helps-to-shape-the-future.aspx">user experience</a> which is a subject I find pretty interesting.I was just thinking about sites that I use frequently. In most cases I'm happy with the user experience; I get the feeling I have a fairly low tolerance for bad design.My other feeling is that the usability-functionality trade off is just the easiest excuse to make where there's a lack of features or poor usability.In business software, the customer wants the biggest bang for buck so they'll demand every feature they can think of. In consumer software, all other things being equal, the most feature-rich application will sell more units.In both cases I think we need to accept it and get focussed on making the desired feature-set work. If the functionality doesn't go into 1.0, it'll need to be there eventually. By leaving it out in the first instance it becomes more difficult to include in a way that makes sense later on.I think the trend over the past 2-3 years has been to roll out features asap and tweak the user experience afterwards. Sites like <a href="http://www.flickr.com">Flickr</a> and to a slightly lesser degree <a href="http://www.last.fm">Last.fm</a> spring to mind.When it works, it works well.</p>
