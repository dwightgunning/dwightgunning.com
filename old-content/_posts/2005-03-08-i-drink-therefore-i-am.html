<p>One of my favourite spirits, <a href="http://www.bundabergrum.com.au/">Bundaberg Rum</a>, has been pulled from the shelves of numerous bars. Owners are saying this is to avoid the agressive behavior that is commonly displayed by drinkers of the iconic liquor. Read all the generalisations <a href="http://www.news.com.au/story/0,10117,12477557-26618,00.html">here</a>. It's worth noting that most of the bars that have decided to stop serving the drink are in Fortitude Valley, a suburb that is was once a mecca for youth sub-culture. Sadly it has rapidly devolved into a trendy cafe precint frequented by upper-middle class wankers.Although not one of my favourite beers, <a href="http://www.heinekeninternational.com/">Heineken</a> have decided to bring the joys of tap beer directly to a kitchen near you. The <a href="http://www.heinekeninternational.com/press/releases/nv/tcm_3-8668.jsp">press release</a> (11th February) describes the BeerTender system. It is comprised of a benchtop gassing/cooling system and makes use of returnable 4 litre beer kegs. See the <a href="http://www.heinekeninternational.com/about/articles/tcm_3-8681.jsp">product description</a> for pictures.Cheers!</p>
