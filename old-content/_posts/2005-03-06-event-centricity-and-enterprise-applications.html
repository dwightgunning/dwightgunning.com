<p>Shai Agassi, board member of <a href="http://www.sap.com">SAP</a>, gave a presentation titled Achieving Enterprise Agility back in November, 2004. <a href="http://www.itconversations.com">IT Conversations</a> are serving up the audio, <a href="http://www.itconversations.com/shows/detail337.html">here</a>.While the approximately 30 minute talk doesn't break any new ground, it ties lots of things together in discussing how organisations will use technology in the next five years. Key topics including Web Services, Mobility and RFID come up as he explains the imminent explosion in the number of business events that an organisation must handle. He also mentions the shift away from code and code maintenance, requiring skilled programmers, towards models and domain specific tools that can be managed by business people. A few of the tech-jokes are also noteworthy.</p>
