<p>I'm pretty sure I've read Brad Feld's explanation of his <a title="Feld Thoughts - The Morning Routine" href="http://www.feld.com/wp/archives/2007/02/the-morning-routine.html">morning routine</a> at least a couple times but for some reason I never got around to implementing my own version.</p>
<p>A little over a week ago I made a plan to spend time each morning on four areas that I believe are really important to making a great start to the day: physical health, mental agility, relationships, planning. Here they are:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">First I'll <strong>wake up and go drink some water</strong> which takes about <em>five minutes</em>. This is just the simple act of killing the alarm, stopping the <a title="Fitbit" href="http://www.fitbit.com/">Fitbit</a>, visiting the bathroom and grabbing 1-2 glasses of water. Aside from the calls of nature, if there's some job or task I feel I need to take care of, I'll only let myself go so far as to put it in the to-do list in my phone.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">I spend the next <em>ten minutes</em> working through a set of <strong>stretches</strong>. I enjoy stretching and find it a good way to give my mind some time to warm up. I'm repeating each stretch twice and holding each for 25 seconds. This seems to be a good trade of between time and the depth of the stretch (before running I'll do 3 x 30 sec.).</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Since I'm now pretty well energised and alert, I launch into some <strong>basic excercises</strong> including a combination of situps, pushups, planks. I alternate and mix this up everyday to keep it interesting. This takes about <em>ten minutes</em> and gets the blood flowing good and proper.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The next activity is somewhat experimental. I'm practicing a <strong>breathing routine</strong> that takes less than <em>five minutes</em> but I it think will help me better manage the nerves I get right before speaking in front of an audience. I'll see how this goes and maybe switch it out at some point.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Following the breathing, I'm nice and calm so it's a good time to <strong>reflect and focus</strong> on what's going on around me for <em>five minutes</em> or so. During this time I tick off in my mind successes/achievements of previous day(s), then consider the areas and means for making improvements. I keep this fairly high-level, vision/goal oriented and avoid worrying about the day-to-day.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">All the above happens in the living room but I'll now shift to my office desk and log-in to my laptop spend the next <em>fifteen minutes</em> rounding up my <strong>to-do list / calendars / email</strong>. I follow the Getting Things Done methodology so this is really a quick review where I check what I've got on during the day ahead and see what I want to focus on.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">To wrap up I'll spend around <em>ten minutes</em> on <strong>News &amp; General Reading</strong>. I have a pretty set list (my fav. Aussie news website, Hacker News, plus a couple blogs). I skim through these fairly quickly and just pick of a couple interesting stories to read. Thanks to Twitter and the social web, somebody is going to tell me about anything truly important that I might miss.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">One last thing, the wildcard is <strong>breakfast</strong> which I take whenever my girlfriend wakes up and wanders into the room. I'm still adjusting and need to focus on this, but the idea is to embrace the interruption and spend <em>fifteen minutes</em> enjoying the company.</p>
<p>All up, this is one hour and fifteen minutes and so far feels about right. Of course I also need to get dressed, shower and shave, and iron a shirt, but that's do-able.</p>
