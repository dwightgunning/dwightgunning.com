<p>A few months back, when starting a project, I had a candid conversation with a manager about how I occaisionally miss a deadline. Probably not the wisest thing to say to a superior who you'll be working for over the coming months. Honest to a fault.He took it well and understood what I meant. I was actually trying to highlight that it was an area I wanted to focus on getting right throughout the project. He mentioned the the common technique: <i>under promise and over deliver</i>. I've passed it on to a few people since, not really considering it too deeply.<a href="http://jchyip.blogspot.com/2005/10/underpromise-and-overdeliver.html">Jason Yip doesn't like it</a> but I think he takes it too literally. In any case it really depends on the circumstance.In the end it really just comes back to honesty. If you're honest about what you think is achievable and you're honest about how you came up with the figure then you've got to be putting yourself in a pretty good position to deliver what's required in the right timeframe.Maybe that's a little utopian but I'll run with it. See the comments, particularly <a href="http://jchyip.blogspot.com/2005/10/underpromise-and-overdeliver.html#112966938979705089">Robert Watkin's point</a> about pragmatism for more about the real world.</p>
