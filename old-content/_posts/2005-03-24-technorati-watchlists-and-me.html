<p>Two things happened yesterday, amongst other things.Firstly I decided I needed to start making use of <a href="http://www.technorati.com">Technorati</a> watchlists. This was prompted by <a href="http://napsterization.org/stories/archives/000400.html">Mary Hodder</a> and the fact that it takes me ages to cut through all my RSS feeds in <a href="http://www.rssbandit.org">Bandit</a>(my current newsreader of choice) and the fact that I'm only really interested in about 1/2 of them.The first thing I did was create a watchlist to look out for blogs that mention me, of course!!! Unfortunately nothing about me specifically came up. Some guy name Dwight's been jailed and lots of people are still writing about the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwight_Eisenhower">34th President of America</a>. I'm not named after either of these blokes, and not even after the character from Frank Miller's 'Sin City' novels. Sin City turned up in the watchlist because Clive Owen is playing the character with my namesake in a new Hollywood release.<img src="http://images1.moviemarket.co.uk/library/posters/503390.jpg" />I'll write about my watchlists soon to let you know how they go. Also, I've never met another person named Dwight so if you know one, send them over so I can say G'day.</p>
