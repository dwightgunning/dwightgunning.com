<p>I've just been fooling around with <a href="http://www.musicbrainz.org/">MusicBrainz</a> and it looks like a really nice tool for tagging mp3's. It's been around for a while. I first noticed it mid way through last year but I didn't really follow through and check it out properly.To be honest I haven't yet used it properly, but I'm sharing it with you anyway for a couple reasons. First is that all my non-techno friends should be able to use it and receive a benefit for doing so. It is probably the best way to get track/album/artist/etc info for CDs and mp3s. The second reason is that it's a great example of how the semantic web &amp; web services can offer powerful new ways of achieving the things you want to achieve.I am really enthusiastic about all this stuff but I see eyes glaze over when I start waffling about the Sem Web and WS. I really wanna get the people I know into this cool stuff! For now, how about I just direct you to somebody else's <a href="http://logicerror.com/musicbrainzArticle">take on MusicBrainz</a>. It's not too technical at all. On the other hand, if you want to see some rdf/xml, try the IBM article '<a href="http://www-128.ibm.com/developerworks/xml/library/x-think14.html">Managing Metadata with MusicBrainz</a>'.</p>
