<p><a href="http://www.engadget.com">Engadget</a> have <a href="http://www.engadget.com/entry/1234000697034975/">pics and details</a> of Sony's new portable audio devices.  Featuring flash memory, the models announced are available in 256Mb, 512Mb and 1Gb varieties.The good news for me is that a couple of the models include FM radio functionality, something that <a href="http://stuntshow.blogspot.com/2004/12/portable-audio.html">I've been chasing</a> in the past. I checked out Sony's range in January while shopping in Tokyo but I wasn't really taken by any of their products and any case I had no money left after making <a href="http://stuntshow.blogspot.com/2005/01/pentax-optio-s5i.html">my other purchases</a>.The Sony release is also <a href="http://ecoustics-cnet.com.com/With+flash+Walkman%2C+Sony+takes+on+iPod+Shuffle/2100-1041_3-5603744.html?tag=cd.top">covered at c-Net</a>. Towards the bottom of the c-net article, an image of a Sony-Ericsson phone <a href="http://news.com.com/Sony+Ericsson+debuts+Walkman+phone%2C+other+models/2100-1039_3-5594425.html?tag=nl">links off to a story from earlier in the week</a> about new phones that use the iconic Walkman branding. These new phones feature 512Mb capacity for storing high quality audio, as well as a 2 MegaPixel camera. Forgive the tangent, I'm about to make a point. I really like the convergence of portable audio, mobile telecommunication and digital photography.In fact love it. I wonder if Sony are concerned about market canibalisation? Afterall, they have a big stake in each area. No matter, I'll let them figure it out while I take a photo of myself listening to music and talking to my mates at the same time. Stay tuned for that!</p>
