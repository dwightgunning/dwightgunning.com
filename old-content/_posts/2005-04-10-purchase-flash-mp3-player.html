<p>After an epic week at work I decided to head to the beach for a dose of vitamin D, followed by some retail therapy.The last week has seen furious swapping of documents amongst colleagues at work so USB-drive functionality became a high priority. I decided on a 256Mb capacity Creative MuVo n200. So far so good. It's got FM reciever functionality with the ability to save 5 presets. Perfect. It takes a single AAA battery so I won't have to wait for an internal or proprietary battery to recharge. The display is fairly readable, although there's not much room for lots of info. I can deal with that. The only thing thats got me bummed is that it takes a special USB cable, different to the one for my camera.So now I've gotta have two USB leads floating around on my desk. cNet have <a href="http://reviews.cnet.com/Creative_MuVo_Micro_N200_256MB_black/4505-6490_7-31208393.html">a short and fair review</a>.I'm looking forward to listening to <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/triplej/jayandthedoctor">Jay &amp; The Doctor</a> tommorrow morning.[EDIT] For related reading check out Mark Cuban's <a href="http://www.blogmaverick.com/entry/1234000000038844/">The countdown for the extension of CDs is about to begin</a>.
