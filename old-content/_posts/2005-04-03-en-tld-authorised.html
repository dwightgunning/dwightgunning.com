<p>Back on the 23rd March, <a href="http://www.theinquirer.net/?article=22066">The Inquirer</a> and <a href="http://www.technorati.com/cosmos/search.html?rank=&amp;url=.eu+domain">The ABC</a> reported that the <a href="http://www.icann.org">ICANN</a> (a non-profit organisation that governs IP address allocation and Top Level Domains) has authorised the <b>.eu </b> country-code top level domain (ccTLD). A thorough post at the <a href="http://www.blogws.com/2005/03/internet-to-get-three-new-domains.html">Blog For Webmasters</a> has all the details.This reminded me of <a href="http://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/TLD">a thought provoking piece</a> that I read last year. Written by <a href="http://www.w3.org/People/Berners-Lee/">Tim Berners-Lee</a> (pioneer of the internet, <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/3899723.stm">Knight</a> and <a href="http://www.internetnews.com/dev-news/article.php/3341741">recipient</a> of large sums of money), the article presents the dangers associated with handing out Top Level Domains left, right and center.</p>
