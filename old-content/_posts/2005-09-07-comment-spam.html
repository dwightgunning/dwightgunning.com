<p>I just experienced my first case of comment spam. A couple of muppets posted complete crap to my previous entry which I promptly deleted.Initially I was thrilled to see the email notifications in my inbox but this quickly turned to disgust when I realised the comments were bogus. I actually had a chuckle at how pathetic their sales pitch sounded.So far my blog has been shielded from the evil acts of spammers by a veil of insignificance. It seems this is no longer a defense, and in any case I'm serious about increasing the significance and credibility of this blog.As a result, I'll be moving it just as soon as I can put aside a little time and cash to research/purchase some decenting hosting.Stay tuned.</p>
