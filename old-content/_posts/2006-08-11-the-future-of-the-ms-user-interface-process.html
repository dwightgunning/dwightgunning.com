<p>A couple weeks back, <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/eugeniop">Eugenio Pace</a> posted <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/eugeniop/archive/2006/07/17/668662.aspx">a piece</a> about the direction Microsoft's Patterns and Practices group are planning to take with the UI Process application block.There's not a lot of meat in the article, it seems they're looking to get feedback from implementers and prioritise requests at this point. What's interesting is some of comments outlining the good and bad of the UIPAB from people who have obviously spent a lot of time with UIP.Extra: <a href="http://www.gotdotnet.com/codegallery/codegallery.aspx?id=0af2b0ef-b049-401a-a2f2-f55a070c1572">GotDotNet  code gallery for UIP</a>.</p>
