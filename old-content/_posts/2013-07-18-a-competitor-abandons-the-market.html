<p>This week I learned through customers, industry contacts and later on the mainstream press that an indirect competitor to my startup, <a title="Revirda" href="https://revirda.com" target="_blank">Revirda</a>, has decided to shutter a relatively new product and, as it would appear, leaving the broader market.</p>
<p>Those who gave me the news had an opinion on what it meant the business and were keen to see my reaction. Some figured that I'd be really happy to hear, others thought it a sign that we're all doomed.</p>
<p>For context, this now former competitor is a listed company that had embarked on a new product line. Their product strategy and our business model, was fundamentally different. We solve the same underlying problem for our customers in quite different ways and I always thought of it more in terms of attention and mindshare. If we'd had near identical products I would be more concerned that they'd learned of some major flaw in the approach or market conditions but right now this isn't of primary concern.</p>
<p>As a founder, I needed a quick yet considered response. Several things came immediately to mind. These are essentially pros and cons but I'll frame them in a slightly differently:</p>
<p><strong>Advantages and opportunities:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It signals to me their chosen business model, based around a "marketplace" was not growing fast enough, or with enough potential revenue to make the venture viable. We have a simpler subscription-based SaaS offering but I'll still look to compare our respective strengths/weaknesses. Ultimately the opportunity is to  identify ways to improve and reinforce the approach we take.</li>
<li>All our data shows that the problem is real and is there to be solved. Our solution and offering still needs refinement but I can take confidence that by working smarter and with perseverance we will deliver the right solution and achieve success.</li>
<li>One less competitor in an increasingly flooded market helps a little but not too much. Given the stage we're at I expect some additional interest and new customers. More significantly I look forward to making new connections and partnerships with stakeholders and companies that have become involved but no longer have somebody to work with.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>O<strong>pen questions and follow ups:</strong><br />
</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="line-height: 13px;">I wonder about the impact to customer sentiment towards my own and other startups in the space. Right from our initial customer interviews we learned that there is skepticism of new companies due to past experiences with fly-by-night merchants that make big promises but never deliver. We need to make certain we deliver what we promise, and continually impress our customers.</span></li>
<li>The fact a large, successful company with engineering bandwidth, existing brand awareness, and marketing expertise can't get their product to fly highlights that we're up against it. This means referring back to our goals and reminding ourselves that we do this as for passion and our customers; not for profit and quarterly forecasts.</li>
<li>I imagine there'll be some effect on confidence and interest in the industry from potential hires and potential investors. I have some thinking to do about how we can make sure people continue to see this as an exciting industry to be in.</li>
</ul>
<p>After those discussions, a little time spent reflecting and noting down a couple actions I'm crystal clear about what needs to happen next. That is to keep an internal focus, ensure we execute our plan and deliver for our customers.</p>
