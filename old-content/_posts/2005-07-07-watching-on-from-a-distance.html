<p>There's blanket coverage of the London bombings on the Teevee; except for Ch7 who are broadcasting a cricket match (being played in England). I remember when this happened from about midnight local time, on the 11th September, 2001, with pictures of New York. And I find it pretty disturbing, or more like a sad indictment on society, that I'm desensitised to what's being shown.I just want information, I don't want journalists and analysts spinning through the same information over and over, spliced with footage that's been shown 3 times already this hour. So I've turned off the Teevee and booted up the laptop to follow a technorati watchlist.My thoughts are with the victims and their families/friends.</p>
