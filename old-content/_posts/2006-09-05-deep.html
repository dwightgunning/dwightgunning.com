<p>I just read <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamie_Zawinski">Jamie Zawinski</a>'s open <a href="http://www.jwz.org/gruntle/nomo.html">letter of resignation</a> from Mozilla.It's an interesting and quite a heartfelt piece. <i>Disclosure</i>I may be seeing it that way because I was always a bit of a netscape fanboy. Taking out the tech references to Netscape and the early days of the web, I found it to be a very honest description of the inner torment and self-doubt one can go through when deciding whether or not to continue on with something they've been super-commited to for a long time.</p>
