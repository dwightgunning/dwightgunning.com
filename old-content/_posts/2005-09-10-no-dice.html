<p>I've successfully negotiated my way to the Sheraton Imperial and checked in without a hitch. I abandoned my plans to blog at the airport because the wireless providers wanted &gt; $10 for an hour of play time. To that I said, <a href="http://www.idiomsite.com/nodice.htm">No Dice!</a>It's humid outside and there's a little smog but I'm sure it has been much worse. I'm going out to take some photos that I can post for you. Seeya.</p>
