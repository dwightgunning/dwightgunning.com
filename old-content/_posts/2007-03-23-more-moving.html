<p>Over the next few weekends I will be shifting my belongings southward on the M1 back to my hometown, the <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;hl=en&amp;q=gold+coast,+australia&amp;layer=&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;z=11&amp;ll=-28.042289,153.396606&amp;spn=0.311501,0.692139&amp;om=1">Gold Coast</a>. The weather and the beaches are too good to be missing out on.Since I've been moving every six to twelve months for the last few years, the thing I find most interesting is that I tend to realise all the things I have and haven't acquired since moving.Like I had plans to buy a bookshelf; instead I've just picked a whole lot more books. Some of the highlights from the last year have been <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Kafka-Shore-Haruki-Murakami/dp/1400079276/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/002-6426307-6802430?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1174692291&amp;sr=8-1">Kafka on the Shore</a> by Haruki Murakami and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Double-Fyodor-Dostoevsky/dp/1600960855/ref=pd_bbs_2/002-6426307-6802430?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1174692399&amp;sr=1-2"> The Double</a> by Dostoevsky.I wanted to get hold of a funky hat stand but I got sidetracked and bought a new <a href="http://www.akubra.com.au">Akubra</a>. I think I got stuck on hats from seeing video clips and old movies from the 40's. It seems like everybody had plenty of style back then.I was supposed to buy a washing machine and all I have is piles of new clothes. This hasn't been so bad as my regular trips to the laundromat in West End which usually turn out to be interesting.</p>
