It costs you $30 and a 5-10 minute chat with one of Queensland's finest public servants.I chose not to point out that it was raining quite heavily and there was no shelter on the sidewalk. I'm sure the officer could see that. And I decided against outlining why I consider myself capable of picking an appropriate moment to cross a road. Clearly the State's lawmakers don't feel that the people of Queensland can be trusted to make these kinds decisions. So I thanked the Officer for his time and walked away to continue dealing with the important things in life.</p>
