<p>Joe Gregorio has a column,<a href="http://www.xml.com/pub/at/34">the Restful Web</a>, and a great blog where he's just mentioned that <a href="http://bitworking.org/news/Hire_Me">he needs a job</a>. Well, I really like reading his stuff, and I am deadset certain he knows what he's on about when it comes to scalable and efficient distributed systems built on web technologies.We need a heap of developers on my current project but I don't see him moving his family to Australia... and I don't do the recruiting so I can't help. But maybe you can?</p>
