<p>Bah I haven't posted in so long - definitely need to get back into the groove.I've been working on a pretty interesting web application at work that uses the Microsoft <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/dnbda/html/uip.asp?frame=true">User Interface Process</a> (UIP) application block for navigation. We're also mixing in quite a few components from <a href="http://www.avanade.com/">Avanade</a>'s ACA (Avanade Connected Architecture) framework.I'm getting a pretty good look at Visual Studio 2005 and Team Foundation Server.I'll try and get organised and post some more about my experiences with these over the next few weeks.</p>
