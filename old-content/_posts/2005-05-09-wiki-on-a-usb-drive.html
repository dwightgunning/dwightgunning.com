<p>I'm fooling with <a href="http://jetty.mortbay.org/">Jetty</a> (pure Java stand-alone web server/servlet container) and <a href="http://www.www.jspwiki.org/">JSP Wiki</a> (self explanatory) to try and get at a lightweight, standalone, run-anywhere-off-a-USB-drive system for keeping notes.So far I have Jetty serving up a dev Wiki instance that I can edit and keep revisions. Cool. I'm just launching from Eclipse at the moment, ant build/deploy tasks coming up tomorrow hopefully. Smoother configuration options to follow soon thereafter.What I want to remember to try and tweak is an on-page option to set the number of revisions to store. Eg. for some pages, the evolution is important but for others it's useless. It would also be nice to be able to remove uneeded revisions too. This wouldn't be any good for public wiki's (without some admin priviledge) and its pretty overly pedantic when it comes to data conservation, but still I'd like to come back and try it one day.</p>
