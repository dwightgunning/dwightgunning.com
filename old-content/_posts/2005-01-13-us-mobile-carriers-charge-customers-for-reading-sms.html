<p>Apparently its been going on forever but <a href="http://www.russellbeattie.com/notebook">Russell Beattie</a> spells it out in his post; <a href="http://www.russellbeattie.com/notebook/1008232.html">2.5 Billion Ways to Screw the American Mobile Consumer</a>.<br />
<blockquote>American carriers charge you for SMS messages received. It's the biggest scam in the world, and this article doesn't do much besides justify the carriers practices. I'm sorry, there's no excuse for the carriers to let this happen....The American carriers, however, are just letting $400 text bills build up on their subscribers accounts because they *know* that there's little their customer can do about it. They're trapped in two year contracts and for many of us, can't live without our phone if it were to get shut off due to non-payment.</p></blockquote>
<p>This sounds similar to the position of Aussie carriers with respect to billing teenagers, although I doubt if any of our telco's would be allowed to get away with putting a charge on incoming SMS.</p>
