<p><a href="http://stuntshow.blogspot.com/2005/05/quick-thoughts-on-opera-vs-firefox.html#c111760950797341763">This comment</a> about my <i>Quick thoughts on Opera vs Firefox</i> prompted me to go and tweak the search engines that Opera supports through fields on its toolbars.It involves a little bit of <code>ini</code> file hacking (easily <a href="http://www.schrode.net/opera/search/search_ini.html">explained</a>) or you could try this <a href="http://starzaki.eu.org/~hclan/operapl/en/">Opera Search.ini Customizer</a>. It works quite well, and Opera supports <code>HTTP:Post</code> search requests. Firefox <a href="http://mycroft.mozdev.org/contribute.html">can't</a> do that.I've still got a couple of things on the next-actions list relating to Firefox so I won't switch back for a little while at least. Yesterday, Jon Udell <a href="http://weblog.infoworld.com/udell/2005/05/31.html#a1241">again posted</a> about Nic Wolff's <a href="http://angel.net/~nic/passwd.html">Password Generator</a>. It's a really neat javascript function that performs an md5 hash against your master password and a website domain to create a unique password for the site. Udell actually did a cool 'screencast' a while back <a href="http://weblog.infoworld.com/udell/gems/singleSignOn.html">which demonstrates</a> it nicely. Anyway, I tried it before but decided it wouldn't work in Opera.So now I've found an extension to this simple single sign-on mechanism, <a href="http://www.xs4all.nl/~jlpoutre/BoT/Javascript/PasswordComposer/">password composer</a>, that uses <a href="http://greasemonkey.mozdev.org/">GreaseMonkey</a> to automate and integrate the process within the site itself. I've been meaning to try GreaseMonkey as well so this'll take care of both.</p>
