<p>I just did a bit of a google for moblogging cause I thought it would be cool to try out some time. Probably when out on the town under the influence of a few beers or something along those lines (no pun! drug references are bad... mmmkay). So anyway I found <a href="http://www.kablog.org/">Kablog</a> which has a J2ME app that looks like it should suit my Nokia <a href="http://www.nokia.com.au/nokia/0,,37035,00.html">6100</a> as well as versions for series 60, palm etc etc. The thing is that I just can't get my Nokia Application Installer to transfer the jad/jar files to my phone.<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/dwightgunning/15456247/"><img src="http://photos13.flickr.com/15456247_443f5054ff.jpg" /></a><font size="1">Thanks <a href="http://www.flickr.com">Flickr</a></font>Bummer!!! Anybody else with a 6100 got it going? Anyway I'm sure its probably my phone or PC thats turned bad on me... so try Kablog!</p>
