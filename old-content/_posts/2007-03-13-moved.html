<p>Last night I got my act together and purchased some hosting and a domain name.Tonight I've installed <a href="http://www.wordpress.org/">WordPress</a> and grabbed a simple but effective plug-in, aptly named <a href="http://www.romantika.name/v2/2007/01/31/import-new-blogger-to-wordpress/">Import New Blogger To WordPress</a>, to drag everything out of my old blog at <a href="http://www.blogger.com">Blogger</a>.Now I just have to wait for the DNSs of the world to do their thing before <a href="http://www.dwightgunning.com">dwightgunning.com</a> comes online. I'll have some more about my host, <a href="http://www.textdrive.com">TextDrive</a> and the blog setup/move when things come online.</p>
