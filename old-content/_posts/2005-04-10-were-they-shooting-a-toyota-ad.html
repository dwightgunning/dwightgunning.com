<p>Last week a Qantas baggage handler was dismissed/suspended/whatever because he found a camel suit amongst some passengers luggage and went for a bit of a trot (do camels trot?) on the tarmac. The ABC are loving it, at latest count they've managed to squeeze 3 articles from the incident (<a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/newsitems/200504/s1341643.htm">one</a>, <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/newsitems/200504/s1341052.htm">two</a>, <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/newsitems/200504/s1340901.htm">three</a>). I love it too, just check <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/reslib/200504/r44571_115256.jpg">their file image</a>.I think I signed something about not discussing the backpack that went MIA after it went with checked baggage on a JetStar (Qantas subsiduary) flight last year.</p>
