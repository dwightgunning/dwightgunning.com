<p>Two gems from <a href="http://jchyip.blogspot.com/">Jason Yip</a> this week. On monday he noted a recent trend in webdesign relating to font size::<br />
<blockquote><b>Old thinking:</b> let's reduce font size and try to cram as much information as we can on the screen.<b>New thinking:</b> let's increase font size and reduce information so people can easily read and understand what's on the screen</p></blockquote>
<p>And on Tuesday, he explained <a href="http://jchyip.blogspot.com/2006/07/what-makes-well-behaved-web.html">what makes a well-behaved web application</a>. This points made in this post are simple and well thought out.I'd like to add that well-behaved web applications should use consistent and logical URLs for the resources being served. If there's too many site areas/sections to link to directly off the main page, give me a short and memorable url so that I can get back there quick (like the ABCs <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news">news</a>, <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/triplej">triplej</a> and <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/rage">rage</a>.I was going to use <a href="http://bitworking.org/">Joe Gregorio</a>'s column, <a href="http://www.xml.com/pub/at/34">The Restful Web</a> at xml.com as an example because for some reason I thought it was www.xml.com/therestfulweb but alas. What the hell kind of resource is represented at "http://www.xml.com/pub/at/34"?Likewise, if it's a multi-user site and I'm a member I want to be able to point my friends/family at my area without me needing to look it up, or them needing a pen and paper (think <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/dwightgunning">http://www.flickr.com/photos/dwightgunning</a> and <a href="http://del.icio.us/dwightgunning">http://del.icio.us/dwightgunning</a>.)My <a href="http://www.writeboard.com">Writeboard</a> which you won't be able to see at "http://123.writeboard.com/37536bb10b817edc9" is a pretty good example of a bad URL to give me for my area.</p>
