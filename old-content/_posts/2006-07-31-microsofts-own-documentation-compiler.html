<p><a href="http://neovolve.com/default.aspx">Rory</a> and I have been following the impending release of Microsoft's  own documentation compiler for the last month or so.Last weeek the first CTP release of <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/sandcastle">SandCastle</a>, as it's known, was made available <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=E82EA71D-DA89-42EE-A715-696E3A4873B2&amp;displaylang=en">here</a>.Scott Hanselman <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/SandcastleMicrosoftCTPOfAHelpCHMFileGeneratorOnTheTailsOfTheDeathOfNDoc.aspx">described </a> the instructions accompanying the release as "ghetto", which is a term I've never before heard used to describe documentation. Quite amusing. Anyway I'm sure it's usable and as soon as I get .Net 2.0 happening on my laptop I'll be trying it out.</p>
