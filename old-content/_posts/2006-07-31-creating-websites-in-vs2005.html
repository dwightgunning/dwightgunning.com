<p>Visual Studio 2005 seems totally counter-intuitive when it comes to creating new Websites. I can't be bothered going through it all right now but basically when you just want to start with a Website, it has to go in a "Solution." You get to specify the physical location of the Website but it shoves the Solution files, which are required, in some other default location and everything turns to crap if you think in terms of physical locations on disk rather than the hybrid physical/abstract path model that Microsoft seem to have taken with Visual Studio.I decided to do some research and found a helpful <a href="http://forums.asp.net/thread/1319838.aspx">forum post</a> that explains that starting with a 'blank solution' will cure this problem.So my next question was where is this magical "Blank Solution" option? It turns out it's in the New Project Wizard, under the 'Other Project Types - Visual Studio Solutions' category. This all seems a bit out of whack to me, and apparently a couple of <a href="http://www.blogger.com/%3Ca%20href="><a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/mrdave/archive/2004/11/13/257066.aspx">other</a> <a href="http://www.coolbits.nu/955.aspx">people</a> </a>agree.</p>
