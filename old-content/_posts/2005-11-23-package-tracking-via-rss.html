<p>According to <a href="http://digg.com/technology/UPS_USPS_Package_tracking_with_an_RSS_feed">Digg</a>, <a href="http://www.simpletracking.com/">SimpleTracking</a> have hooked into UPS and USPS tacking systems and offfer status updates via RSS. I <a href="http://stuntshow.blogspot.com/2005/02/rss-for-ecommerce-order-tracking.html">suggested</a> this would be cool back in February.I wonder if <a href="http://www.auspost.com.au/">Aussie Post</a> &amp; <a href="http://www.aae.com.au/">Australian Air Express</a> have any plans to do likewise?</p>
