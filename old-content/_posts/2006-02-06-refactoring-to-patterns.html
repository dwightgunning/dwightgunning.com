<p>Last weekend I dropped into <a href="http://www.mcgills.com.au">McGills</a> bookstore and picked up <a href="http://industriallogic.com/xp/refactoring/">Refactoring to Patterns</a> by Joshua Kerievsky.As the title suggests, it steps the reader through a series of refactorings that lead to (or in some cases just 'towards') common design patterns. It's a nice merger of the principles discussed in Fowler's 'Refactoring' and 'Design Patterns' by the Gang of Four.While it's probably not going to be life changing for anybody who's familiar with those two books, it does a pretty fine job of explaining the how an application will benefit from combining refactoring and patterns. Despite the fact they're seemingly counter to one and other with respect to Design Up Front vs. Agile.</p>
