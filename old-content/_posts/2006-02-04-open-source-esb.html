<div>I just stumbled across <a href="http://celtix.objectweb.org/index.html">Celtix</a>, an Enterprise Service Bus, from the <a href="http://www.objectweb.org">ObjectWeb</a> consortium who do open source middleware.I'm downloading it now cause I want to check it out but I really don't have any business apps running on my desktop that need to integrate. I'll see if I can come up with something to muck around with.</div>
