<p>I've been out and seen movies twice this week. Which is highly unusual for me... but not as unusual as the movies themselves.Two biographical flicks and two heroes who died before their time.Monday night was 'Into the Wild', directed by Sean Penn. It's based on a true story about a young guy who's basically had jack of his parents and from there decides he's not up for society in general. He's super strong willed, physically tough and decides to head into the Alaskian wilderness to tough it out on his own. See the <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0758758/">IMDB</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Into_the_Wild_%28film%29">Wikipedia</a> pages.Tuesday night was 'Control', whose subject is Ian Curtis. It tells the story of the his early involvement with Joy Division and their rapid ascent to stardom. It also looks closely at how this affected his marriage and other relationships up until to his suicide on the eve of the band's first tour of the US. See the <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0421082/">IMDB</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_%282007_film%29">Wikipedia</a> pages.Both amazing stories. Recommended for viewing on DVD in the comfort and safety of your own home.</p>
