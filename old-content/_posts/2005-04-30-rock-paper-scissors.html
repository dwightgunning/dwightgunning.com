<p>Such a splendid game.<img src="http://www.worldrps.com/images/OfficialRPSGuide.gif" />A couple of weeks back I bought a copy of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0743267516/qid=1114848188/sr=1-1/ref=sr_1_1/103-3372576-4163055?v=glance&amp;s=books">The official Rock, Paper, Scissors Strategy Guide</a>. It was in the humor section of the bookstore and was labelled as such. I'm still undecided about whether its serious or not, there's an <a href="http://www.worldrps.com">Official RPS Website</a> where they have a fair bit of info and a forum. It's pretty light reading, as my high school english teacher would say "you'd be able to get through it in one sitting in the john." I think he was referring to <i>Of mice and men</i>. Anywho...Here's <a href="http://www.news.com.au/story/0,10117,15132693-38198,00.html">the news</a> that makes all of this post-worthy.</p>
