<p>Tonight I started thinking about requirements for this new pet project of mine.The business will be based mostly online and be mainly self-service on the part of the customer. One thing I'd really like to do is offer some features that really encourage interactivity/communication amongst the customers and with myself.The concept isn't revolutionary so it's not going to make it to <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com">TechCrunch</a> and although there's quite a few players already involved, the market is big enough and should only continue to grow. I'm pretty confident that it can be profittable. I guess I need to sit down and nut this out properly at some point pretty soon.So I was thinking about how to gather the requirements and decided I should get a little bit <a href="http://www.extremeprogramming.org">XP</a> by taking the <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?UserStory">User Story</a> approach. I'm partnering up with a non-techie who's definitely an expert in the field so I'm try and get them to drive out the stories. After that I'll try the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_Programming_Practices#Planning_game">Planning Game</a>.Right now I'm just going to run with it for a while and see where it all ends up. My expectations aren't real high but I really want to get something out there on the web and give it a bit of a shake. I'm bound to learn a few things, right?</p>
