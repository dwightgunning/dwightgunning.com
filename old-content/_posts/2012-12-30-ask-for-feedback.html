<p>Perception is reality. A simple enough proposition when you only take your own point of view into consideration. However another persons view of any given topic is certain to vary at least slightly to your own. More often then not the difference will be material. The only way to find out is to ask the person to explain how they see it. </p>
<p>What if the 'something' is you and how you're doing at your life, your relationship, your work?</p>
<p>It surprises me how rarely we ask each other for feedback. I think our natural disposition is to assume we're correct and we do things the right way. We assume somebody will tell us if we're doing something wrong. This is disastrous as so many opportunities to better understand ourselves and improve the way we do things are missed.</p>
<p>There is no time like the present. Ask the next person you see who you know well for some feedback.</p>
