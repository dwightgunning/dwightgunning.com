<p>Just read about <a href="http://weblog.infoworld.com/udell/2006/07/18.html#a1488">Jon Udell's habit of breaking habits</a>. He mentions a couple cool lifehacks for productivity and some interesting desktop tools for Windows/Mac/Linux.I too only recently discovered thow to hide all the items on the desktop. Jon found it useful for productivity; I was just keen to get a better look at my desktop background. He goes on and identifies what would be some really neat desktop features like fading out and eventually removing icons that are rarely used.One thing I thought of to increase my own productivity, or moreso to lower the number of times through the day that I'm distracted from the task at hand, was to get rid of the 'new mail' popup and envelope icon that appears in the status tray.Hopefully my curiousity about who might have emailed me in the last 10 minutes will subside since I don't have such an obvious visual cue anymore. Instead I'll be more concious of when I have a logical point to break from my current task and a when is a good time to take a look at the inbox.Setting the aggregator to update every 3 hours instead of 1 and unsubscribing from <a href="http://digg.com/">digg</a> also helps.</p>
